write up properly, but I'll put it here anyhow, since I do want others' opinions on this!**\n	- *What values does this community have regarding role-play in PSO2NGS?*\n		- Currently I'm thinking that this community will be mostly-lore abiding, meaning that the RP would mostly consist of interactions and events that could be explained within existing canon, and that the basis for personal canon shouldn't stem from outside of PSO2, but rather from the game's existing canon.\n		- I think RP should be cooperative and I think that we should have a system in place for allowing for discussion in a constructive and helpful way. Thereby eliminating the problems of having some people go off on their own tangents and unpurposely *(or purposely)* excluding others since the goal is that everyone should be able to cooperate without feeling the \"need\" to have to break lore.\n			- *Sub-point to this:* This isn't something that I think should be a black-and-white thing, as long as **everyone** gets along with the ideas that comes up, then anything goes.\n\n		- Civility is an important thing aswell, I do not think that we should discourage others from coming up with \"crazy\" ideas, but we need to relate to the lore, so it's a fine balance that we've all got to help reach.\n\n---\n### Lore Channel:\n\n\u003e Status: TBD\n\n- **Channel for storing lore?**\n	- *How should we store that?*\n	- *How do we format the lore?*\n\n---\n\n### Which block?\n\n\u003e Status: TBD\n\n- **What block should we use?**\n	- *Current idea is to stay on B26.*\n\n---\n\n### Community name:\n\n\u003e Status: TBD\n\n- **Name for the Discord?**\n	- *Currently it's \"The 26th ARKs Division\"*.\n	- ***Sub-issue:*** *Logo's dependent on the name, so for the moment it's not permanent, it'll change with how the community wants it to be.*\n\n---\n\n### Social links (where?):\n\n\u003e Status: TBD\n\n- **Screenshots channel and personal twitters?**\n	- *Do we want to post twitter-links (or similar) in #character-screenshots or should we seperate the two into something like \" #twitter-posts \"?*\n\n---\n\n### Personal roles:\n\n\u003e Status: Done! *(-ish)*\n\n- #### Added personal roles - Some things will be changed further on, but for now it's okay.\n\n*Old:*\n\u003e *~~#### **These specifically are things that can be changed as we go, it's not the biggest deal to have this come as it goes.**~~*\n\u003e - *~~**Personal roles!**~~*\n\u003e 	- *~~*Prounouns!*~~*\n\u003e 		- *~~They/Them~~*\n\u003e 		- *~~He/Him~~*\n\u003e 		- *~~She/Her~~*\n\u003e 		- *~~Anything else?~~*\n\u003e 	- *~~*Artist?*~~*\n\u003e 	- *~~*Wiki Contributor?*~~*\n\u003e 		- *~~Ergo, you send things like logs in, or that that you help in other ways.~~*\n\u003e 	- ~~*Play time?*~~\n\u003e 		- ~~*Question-mark regarding this; should we format it like this, sort of: (?)*~~\n\u003e 			- *~~\"Newbie\"?~~*\n\u003e 			-* ~~\"Advanced\"?~~*\n\u003e 			- *~~\"No-lifer\"?~~*\n\u003e 		- *~~Or as: (?)~~*\n\u003e 			- *~~100+ hours~~*\n\u003e 			- *~~500+ hours~~*\n\u003e 			- *~~1000+ hours~~*\n\u003e 			- *~~Etc etc.~~*\n\n\n---\n\n### Wikihelp!\n\n\u003e Status: Still looking!\n\n- **Making the wiki is fun and all, but I could use some help with proof-reading logs and formatting them properly - along with working on community-character sheets!**\n	- *This would be completely voluntary and I'd personally help you :)*\n\n---\n\n### NGS Leaks / Spoilers:\n\n\u003e Status: **Done**\n\n- ~~**NGS Leaks/Spoilers channel?**~~\n	- ~~*I essentially think this can be added, it's just a matter of formatting - ergo it's on the todo-list.*~~\n---\n- **Anything else?

Due to her job as an ARKs operative, she has learned to open up to fellow operatives more easily.\n\nWhile her Dark Personality is in control, she shows immense distrust to people around her other than [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) and sometimes an occasional bout of anger if anyone is too pushy getting close to her. She tends to be incredibly aggressive and rough with anyone who bothers her and spends a lot of time in the training rooms.\n\nShe avoids the subject of family as much as she can due to bitter memories and depending on the personality that is in control, if the subject is brought up, different reactions will occur.\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Background (Pre-NGS):\n\n#### [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) was born on the 21st of July in the family hospital alongside her sister into a noble kitsune family where they had lived a fairly carefree life, being brought up around their parents business and slowly learning that it wasn’t what it had been portrayed to be. As tradition with the rest of the family at birth, they were tested for compatibility with Photons in which they were to be taught how to use when they became of age, which they were both found to be highly compatible. Regardless of the questionable activities, she never questioned it as she didn’t think it was her place and so she carried on with life as normal until a series of unfortunate events occurred that changed her life forever.\n\nOn [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md)'s 16th birthday, due to her family business that had operated in a less than ethical manner for over a decade, members of the family and any associated with them were at risk of being targeted by groups that wanted to see justice for their actions. Regrettably, she had witnessed an assassination first hand and was left alive to send a message to the rest family.\n\nThe group had targeted her best friend's family who had many dealings with her own. It was a birthday like any other, [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) was spoiled and pampered by her family like every birthday before and her best friends was invited to celebrate with her. However, regardless of the occasion, the day turned out to be one of the worst in her life with her best friend being murdered in front of her. They were in the process of making their way to the dining room with her best friend's parents, her own parents and sister already there, to finally cut the cake when multiple masked assailants had burst through the windows, instantly taking down her friend's parents with swift strikes to their throats, their bodies hitting the floor with a thud.\n\nThe assailants then restrained the two girls and a knife was brought to her friends neck. “Remember this day, for this is what will happen to the rest of you” were the words she would remember forever before the assailant had dramatically cut her friends throat in a straight, clean line, her life instantly draining from her eyes. [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had wanted to scream, but her voice could not find its way from her throat. She had just sat there stiffly while the assassin made their clean escape until her own parents had eventually found her within the tragedy, surrounded with puddles of blood and a blank look in her eyes.\n\nShe felt herself break that day.\n\nIt took about 3 months after the assassination before her split personality became apparent. Constant whispers within her head consisting of dark thoughts became very prominent and while she tried to ignore them, they plagued her sleep as well. It eventually came to the fateful day where life got even worse than she thought it could.\n\nShe had been on her way to her sister's room to find some comfort from these dark thoughts, however on her way there, for no apparent reason, she had blacked out. When she had finally regained consciousness, she had found herself in her destination but instead of comfort, she found horror and sorrow. There was her sister, with a stab wound through her chest in place of her heart and to make matters worse, [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had looked down to see the murder weapon in her hand still fresh with blood. She was found soon after by her family, completely frozen in place and tears streaming down her face.\n\nIt was the very next day in which she not only was diagnosed with split personalities with her vague recount of what had happened and revealing she had been hearing voices in her head, but was also banished from the family due to the acts she had committed with the only promise of nothing being said. She had later figured this was likely to keep the families image up in the world of their business.\n\nhe had lived on the streets for a while, trusting no one but herself and with this came familiarity with the voice in her head which she had dubbed [](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) and who in turn had called her [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md). From talking with [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md), she had found they were polar opposites. Where she was calm and collected, [](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) was aggressive and rough. Due to their symbiotic bond and the passing months, they formed a bond out of necessity to survive and because of this, [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had dialled in her violent tendencies and promised that she wouldn't force control if she was let out once in awhile which they found to be possible by manipulating the Photons inside them.\n\nTo survive the months alone, they had mainly worked at sketchier businesses that didn't care for her age and were in need of labour. This work had mostly been left to [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) who found it easier to adapt to the hard work as well as the fact she found she had an innate need to protect [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) from any further suffering in the world.\n\nThey had spent about 9 months of doing this before she decided they wanted to do something more with her life, perhaps by utilising their high compatibility for Photons. So on her 17th birthday, she applied to ARKs as a potential recruit and before long, they had been taking part in the ARKs training course. She had been required to disclose her split personality during her training which had prompted the ARKs counsellors, as well their scientists, to thoroughly evaluate her to make sure she was fit to be an operative and how she was able to enable the switch along with the changes in appearance for each personality. After thorough testing, [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had been approved for further training and due to her unique circumstances, had been given two specialities. [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had found to be the perfect fit for an assassin, which she had thought to be ironic considering how she had been created, whereas [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) was found to be highly efficient as a healer with her need to stop anymore suffering within her life.\n\nThey worked their way through the ranks for the next 3 years, eventually becoming a well known operative throughout the ships for her unbreakable resolve to see every mission through and their stellar record for sustaining no casualties in any of their missions. They had also learned to further utilise their unique condition to the point they could now change their clothes when switching the personality in control, allowing for instantaneous response if a mission hadn't gone to plan. [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had become a very dependable Operative through the years enabling her the privilege of being acquainted with the upper Echelons of ARKs leading to her being sanctioned to the Council of Six as a specialist in her craft and candidate for any missions that were deemed confidential or too high a risk for other ARKs Operatives.\n\n### Background (Post-NGS):\n#### Like most [Meteorns](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md), [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) awoke to the emergency pod's door hiss as it opened to an unfamiliar world, her heterochromatic eyes quickly adjusting to the sunlight spilling into the pod. Her first steps were unsteady as she stepped onto the beach, her mind trying to puzzle together anything that would explain her current situation but finding nothing but a clouded haze over her memories.\n\nHer body weak, from what she assumed was an extended stay in the pod, caused her head to spin as her legs gave out from under her. She fell to her knees at the ocean's edge, her face mere inches from the mirror-like water, her own face staring back looking confused and dazed. The reflection in front of her quickly morphed into a version of herself with black hair and red eyes as a voice rang out in her head calling the name \"[Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md)\", her mind bursting into splitting pain as she fell back into the sand cradling her head. A single name spilled from her lips as she passed out under the blazing sun, the memory of alter personality falling into place within her mind as if it were a puzzle piece. \"[Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md).\"\n\nWhen [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) next awoke, she was in an unfamiliar city hidden away in the alleys between buildings, her head no longer in pure agony and her mind now clear with the only thing in mind. She had spoken her alter's name within their shared mind, the opposite personality quickly answering as they took comfort in each other's presence. [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had learned that when she had passed out, [](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had taken control and gotten them to safety within the city which she had found was aptly named \"[Central City](SubIndexes/Places/Aelio/CentralCity.md)\". Like her, [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) also had no recollection of how they had gotten to this strange new world and could only remember the other personality.\n\nThe two had quickly adapted to the new world, finding that others like her were a common occurrence and were referred to as \"Meteorn\". Those referred to as such seemed to be highly efficient as part of the local defense force; ARKs in a variety of job roles.\n\n[Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had taken quickly to being a Tactical Operator as well as a Field Medic, finding that she had a particular knack for the support role and an innate need to protect those around her. [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md), on the other hand, had found she specialized more so in combat and preferred being on the battlefield destroying all the DOLLs she could with extreme efficiency. [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md), however, much preferred taking on her own jobs and tried to stay away from ARKs operations that were shrouded in regulations and operated more so like a mercenary completing whatever requests had interested her.\n\nAs part of her many jobs as both Operator and Mercenary, [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had met many others like her, one such person being [Gaia Stellaria](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md), who had struck her with a strange familiarity and sense of trust, a rare and unfamiliar feeling for the two personalities. They had struck a quick friendship over their similar hybrid states and [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had found herself divulging her dual personality to the woman before long, who treated it as if it was entirely normal.\n\nThrough [Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md), she had met a group of people including a [Fish Princess](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md) and her [Raptor partner](SubIndexes/Characters/GogoMes.md) along with a [Cat-Deuman hybrid](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) similar to herself. [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) found herself working closely with this group of people, providing tactical support for their missions and patching them up whenever needed. [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) still preferred to operate separately as of now as she doesn't wish to harm the relationships that her alter had been able to form with the news of their dual personality which many viewed as a terrible condition.   \n",title:"Equinox"},"/SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Gaia Stellaria\"\n---\n\n## *''I don't know what I am doing, just making stuff up as I go and I am pretty good at that.''*\n\n---\n\n![Gaia](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edd1ee/quartz/hugo/content/Images/Screenshots/Gaia.png?style=centerme)\n\n---\n\n\u003e ### Details:\n\u003e -   **Name:** Tianea 'Gaia' Stellaria\n\u003e -   **Race:** Self gene-spliced Newman\n\u003e -   **Height:** 180 cms\n\u003e -   **Age:** 30 years old (as of episode 5)\n\u003e -   **Gender:** Woman\n\u003e -   **Occupation/Archetype:** Explorer, Scientist, Engineer, Recon\n\u003e -   **Weaponry:** Generally equipped with a prototype she made herself.

Tianea lived a rather secluded existence at home while her parents were away on assignments for prolonged periods.\n\nShe was shy and reserved, but very studious and had a strong will to learn about anything that interested her. Mainly studying from home, she had above average grades, which could've been better if she had any interest in her subjects.\n\nMedical Reports salvaged from her origin ship state she had some vitamin and mineral deficiencies and this was why she was mostly at home, which made her fragile and susceptible to sickness.\n\nYears passed and while she kept her grades on above-average, but not the highest they could've been, she had started studying biology at home on the side, using plants. She managed to create a remedy for her deficiencies and solved many of her innate issues.\n\nSaid medicine only seemed to work on herself, indicating some variable that only matched with herself.\n\nWhen she turned 16, tragedy struck. Her ship was one of the victims in a falspawn attack. Tianeas parents had quickly managed to have Tianea evacuated to another ship through their pilot contacts. Tianea had to leave it all behind in a rush, given only an ''emergency package'' of stuff to bring with her to Thorn.\n\nAs the shuttle took off, Tianea watched as her neighborhood collapsed into a massive cloud of dust and debris. When she arrived on Thorn, she was hurried off with no directions or any idea what to do. She was not sure if her parents were coming for her, but she assumed the best and waited near the Gate she had been dropped at.\n\n Days passed, no one had come for her. No one seemed to even have noticed she had been dropped off. Perhaps her shy and secluded nature removed her presence and made her invisible.\n\nThe last actual account of Tianea at this point was that she had disappeared into the city and vanished, with her emergency package in hand.  \nThis was also the last time she ever called herself Tianea.\n\nYears passed and Gaia, as a nickname of sorts, had appeared in some dark alleys and rumours mentioning someone in an abandoned wing dealing with custom machinery, cast parts and making performance drugs.\n\nThis would prove to be Tianea, still researching, building and producing whatever she felt interested in and had the ability to work with.\n\nSometime after disappearing, Gaia had discovered a small photonic aptitude which she was capable of using as a supplement to her machinery and science. Also how she made medicine that only worked on herself, she had discovered.\n\nShe had also managed to pass ARKS training and become a member, both as a researcher and a soldier.\n\nToday, she still offers custom tech services, both within engineering and biotech. She is also offering a selection of medicines and drugs, some which she donates to ARKS as a means of contributing.  \nSomewhere between then and now, she has managed to splice her own DNA with that of dragons, causing her to sprout horns and tail, among other generally reptilian traits and also strengthening her body, curing herself of her frailness.\n",title:"Gaia Stellaria"},"/SubIndexes/Characters/GogoMes":{content:'---\ntitle: "Gogo Mes"\n---\n\n\n\n\u003e ## "If you have an issue with something, you can count on me!"\n\n---\n\n![Gogogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edd1ee/quartz/hugo/content/Images/Screenshots/gogo.png?style=centerme)\n\n---\n\n### Details:\n\n\u003e -   **Name:** Gogo Mes\n\u003e -   **Race:** Raptor\n\u003e -   **Height:** 168 cms\n\u003e -   **Age:** 20 years old\n\u003e -   **Gender:** Woman\n\u003e -   **Occupation:** Guard on home planet.\n\u003e -   **Weaponry:** Dual-wielding guns.\n\u003e -   **Pronouns:** She/They\n\n---\n\n\n### Personality:\n\nInsert personality here.\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Background:\nShe\'s the girlfriend of [Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md).\n\n---\n\n# Artworks:\n![Gogogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edd1ee/quartz/hugo/content/Images/art/MantisPray2Art/gogowaa.png?style=centerme)\n\n![Gogogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edd1ee/quartz/hugo/content/Images/art/MantisPray2Art/huggg.png?style=centerme)\n\n![Gogogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edd1ee/quartz/hugo/content/Images/art/MantisPray2Art/kabedon.png?style=centerme)\n\n![Gogogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edd1ee/quartz/hugo/content/Images/art/MantisPray2Art/themtmmm.png?style=centerme)\n\n![Gogogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edd1ee/quartz/hugo/content/Images/art/MantisPray2Art/themtwhem.png?style=centerme)\n\n![Gogogo](https://github.com/Edd1ee/quartz/blob/hugo/content/Images/art/MantisPray2Art/women.png?raw=true?style=centerme)\n\n### All artworks above are made by [Mantispray](https://twitter.com/MantisPray2) (Twitter)\n',title:"Gogo Mes"},"/SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Lady Lilit Lichenaes of Atlantis and Mercia III\"\n---\n\n\u003e ## ''You don't wanna know what I did to get these legs.\"\n\u003e *(You really don't wanna know...)*\n\n---\n\n![lilit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edd1ee/quartz/hugo/content/Images/Screenshots/lilit.png?style=centerme)\n\n---\n\n\u003e #### Details:\n\u003e-   **Name:** Lilit Lichenaes\n\u003e-   **Race:** Fish person\n\u003e-   **Height:** 200 cms\n\u003e-   **Age:** Several hundreds of years, but visually and mentally between 22-24. _(Fish people age slowly)_\n\u003e-   **Gender:** Woman\n\u003e-   **Occupation/Archetype:** Heir to the throne\n\u003e-   **Weaponry:** Ice rod or bow.

However, her attempt is unsuccessful and she must quickly flee the fish kingdom. In a shady, probably not legal, deal she acquired some legs and quickly began making her way to land. Above the sea she discovered a whole new world of weaponry and people, and made it her mission to learn from them and grow as powerful as she could.\n\nAbove ground she met many sympathetic people, including her girlfriend [Gogo Mes](SubIndexes/Characters/GogoMes.md) and her best friend [Nora Honora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md).

However, she often is very oblivious to this, *e.g:*\n\n \u003eShe'd eat a meal and say that it tastes bad, not due to her wanting to be mean or condescending - but because she doesn't think lying would be beneficial to the chef's development. Because, for her, food does not have any emotional connection to the chef.\n\nThough it is a nice underlying thought, she lacks the social know-how to express this in a good way without deeply offending most people, which inhibits her to befriend people.\n\n\n---\n\n## Nora's past:\n#### (Spoilers, duh.)\n\n#### What she knows:\n\n[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md), along with most other [Meteorns](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md), can't remember much of her past. She has *vague* memories of her family spending time in cafés or restaurants, so she likes spending time at the café.\n\n\n#### Growing up:\n\n[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s childhood was quite calm, other than the occasional ARKs emergencies that paralleled her life. Her family consisted of her and her two parents, one being an ARKs defender and the other a café worker. As she was not old enough to go out into combat, [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) instead studied for many years and learned about many different myths and philosophies, *(some of which even stuck with her after the crash on [Halpha](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md).)*\n\nAt the age of seventeen, [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) began working alongside her parent at their café. [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md), being quite the diligent worker, was an exemplary waitress and was a near-natural at making different drinks and foods. The only plight being her poor social skills, leading to many failed interactions between her and customers, even so, she pulled through.\n\n\u003e *(Note; I haven't really thought of an appropriate accident, so for now this part is mostly a placeholder.)*\n\nNot so long after she'd began working at the café  , she would suffer through an accident where the only solution for saving her life was to gene-splice her with another living being, though that would mean killing that other being. She'd been rushed to the emergency room with her parents by her side, both of whom offered to sacrifice themselves. [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md), of course, did not want that to happen and resisted for as long as she could, but after some time she passed out and could not resist no more. [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) was put under for the time being, giving the parents time to console the medical team for a few hours before doing the procedure.\n\nOne of the scientist who'd been working that day, [Gaia Stellaria](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md), had an idea to save the Deumen's lives - the idea being to gene-splice [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) with a cat that [Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) had taken from the streets. [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s parents were completely opposed to this, making it hard for the dear scientist to help. As the time had not yet ran out and it was nearing night, [Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) had devised a plan to save the girl without killing one of her parents. Whilst the parents were sound asleep, she took [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) to her private lab and began the gene-splicing process. A rather large tail and cat ears began growing and in the middle of the procedure [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) woke up to mind-bending agony and pain due to her bones stretching and growing. The pain pulsed throughout her body as her cells were being rewritten on the molecular level. Screams could even be heard from the outside of the *seemingly mad* scientist's lab.\n\nIn the morning, [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) had been found outside of her room, unconcious on the floor.  Her parents pulled her onto her bed, shocked at the new features. A few moments pass before the doctors confirm that she was fine and well. Though her parents were outraged at the hospital's horrible safety standards, they were despite this glad that their only daughter was okay. [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) could not remember much from this event even before she'd arrived on [Halpha](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md), only slight glimpses of the procedure remain engrained in her mind.\n\n---\n\n#### Leading up to the present:\n\u003e (As we've not gotten much information regarding this, this'll be rather bare-bones.)\n\nShortly after her procedure, yet another incident happened resulting in mass-evacuations. [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s parent who worked in the ARKs, had decided to send her away in an emergency pod to yet again save her life. Nobody knows what happened that led to these events - but, it resulted in the crash-down experience that so many [meteorns](SubIndexes/Concepts/Meteorns.md) share;\n\n[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md), being scared, confused and cold, awoke to the banging sound on her emergency pod. She'd not yet acclimatized to her senses from the procedure and she instinctively covered her fluffy ears to shield herself from the sound. The pod began hissing as it opened and it took a moment before she could fully see properly. She proceeded to stumble out of the pod, visibly confused and then passed out on the ground.\n\nShe would awake and have a few glimpses here and there as she was being pulled towards [an unfamiliar city](SubIndexes/Places/Aelio/CentralCity.md). Around her was strangely alien landscape that'd she'd never seen before. Her head felt emptier than deep space and she could barely remember her own name.\nThe next few days were spent recovering at the hospital. Where she regained some memories, but *far* from all of them.\n\nAfter a swift recovery, [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) began discovering [Central City](SubIndexes/Places/Aelio/CentralCity.md), finding that she loved spending time in the command room reading a plethora of summaries, logs and stories from other ARK defenders. She also found her way back to the myths and stories aforementioned that she had read about in her younger years. The stories gave her some comfort, despite her not remembering why she felt that way.\n\nHer constant reading led to some justified boredom, to which she decided to remedy it by enrolling in the 26th ARKS division. There, she felt right at home - again having that feeling of comfort.\n",title:"Nora Honora"},"/SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C":{content:'---\ntitle: "Rosie"\n---\n\n \u003e ## "Uwah!~"\n\n---\n\n![RO-C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edd1ee/quartz/hugo/content/Images/Screenshots/roc.png?style=centerme)\n\n---\n\n\u003e ### Details:\n\u003e - **Name**: Rosie Clements\n\u003e - **Race**: Cast\n\u003e - **Height**: 154 cms\n\u003e - **Age**: 13 years old\n\u003e - **Gender**: Woman\n\u003e - **Occupation/Archetype**: Student, civilian\n\u003e - **Pronouns**: She/They\n\n---\n\n### Personality:\nRosie is a reserved young girl who yearns to see the world beyond the walls of [Central City](SubIndexes/Places/Aelio/CentralCity.md).

With the onset and resurgence of the Dark Falz and the subsequent wars that followed suit, [Project Yggdrasil](SubIndexes/Logs/finishedlogs/ArksLogs/ProjectYggdrasil.md) casts were repurposed and reassigned to multiple forward operating positions and combat roles within the ARKS military as a whole.*\n\n*While not quite a small number of [Project Yggdrasil](SubIndexes/Logs/finishedlogs/ArksLogs/ProjectYggdrasil.md) casts were built, ranging somewhere in the mid 100\'s; most, if not all refer to eachother as some sort of family, or in the very least share some sort of familial bond with one another.

As such, She has been integrated with a number of experimental subsystems which were designed to test their viability in the next generation of casts. While not all test systems proved beneficial, in the end, her use as a test bed was a vital step in the subsequent successes of the later generation Yggdrasil casts.*\n\n*Following the start of the Darker Wars, Model 000 was reassigned to the Central Research Department, more commonly reffered to as VOID to undergo more experimental tests as well as modifications to better suit her needs as a soon to be frontline ARKS soldier. She would go on to lead a small force under the CRD to combat and sometimes capture Falz threats on the orders of VOID command.*\n\n*After the third re-organisation in AP 239, [Model 000 Alpha](SubIndexes/Characters/Yokai.md) was once again reassigned, this time under the Combat Bureau where she spent the remainder of her ARKS career, that is until all records of her whereabouts were lost around a decade later."*\n\n*It is still unknown as of writing this document, of whether [Model 000 Alpha](SubIndexes/Characters/Yokai.md) is deceased, MIA, or for all intents and purposes, gone without a trace.*\n\n#### ==================================\n\n\u003e ##### -Expunge ALL\n\n...\n\n## // All access records from this terminal from the past 24 hours have been successfully removed from the log.

These discharges from the sand/thunderstorms give them the ability to float around with no inhibition. \nThe experiments ran showed that the possibilities for this technology appear to be rather grand.  \n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\n![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/6.png?raw=true?style=centerme)\n\nThe fragments appear to be of a material th	at allows them to be super-charged with static electricity, allowing them to float uninhibited in the air. \nThe current understanding of Stellar Fragments at this point is lacking. So, my goal is to gain a deeper understanding of them and their potential for carrying electric charges. I've been investigating the phenomena of these fragments since they seem to have properties desirable for furthering our defense capabilities against the threat of DOLLs. \nI hypothesize that the Stellar Fragments are composed of materials that allow charges to be built similarly to batteries, just at a larger scale. Possibly useful for the mega-weapon the commander is constructing.\n\nI approached the Stellar Fragments' experimentation with caution. It was crucial to sustaining the electric charge to study the material in its charged state, but also, once discharged, I sought to recharge them. It was done with extreme precaution since I'd noticed them violently discharge, or in layman's terms, explode. \n\nDue to the fragments' properties, I hope to utilize them as a large-scale battery for possible use in combat.\n\n---\n\n## Methods\n\n#### Field description:\nThe items that I studied were Stellar Fragments, twenty of them. These samples were collected in [West Retem, by the Sagan Mountain Road: East Ryuker Device](SubIndexes/Places/Retem/Retem.md) (D/E2 on the map). The area that we collected the samples in had, like most other areas in [Retem](SubIndexes/Places/Retem/Retem.md), mostly sandy surroundings, with occasional patches of grass- or moss-like vegetation. Along with the aforementioned attributes, floating rocks were littering the area. They were floating for the same reason as the Stellar Fragments, I assume due to the static electricity. However, Stellar Fragments are different since they continued floating in the air. That being, even after I brought them outside of the affected area.\n\n#### Sample Design:\n\nI've decided that the sampling population is what most people would call Stellar Fragments; ergo, meteorite fragments containing crystal-like materials capable of carrying electric charges. These fragments appear every day, coinciding with the sandstorms and meteorites falling to the ground. \n\nI chose to collect 20 Stellar Fragments for experimenting on, which I divided into 4 test groups - 5 for control, 5 to test for a small electric charge, another 5 for a medium electric charge, and the last 5 for a large electric charge.\nTo be able to compare the fragments before and after the experiments, I kept a control group.\nFor the electric charge, I chose to charge the Stellar fragments for a period but with a small charge, to reduce the risk of spontaneous discharge. \nThe timeframe I chose was around 20-minute intervals between \"charging-step\". \nSo, the first step would be 20 minutes, then the next 40 minutes, and the last would be 60 minutes/1h.\nThe charge amount is the amount the Fragments individually let out - I quantify that as the factor that is the maximum charge amount, for now. \n\n- **Formula:**\n(X×P) / T = *Total Capacity*\n\n**To clarify for replication purposes:**\n\"X\" *(= Full capacity, as a function of P and Time)* amount of P *(= Power)* divided by T *(time)*, then charged up to a \"full\" amount, which would equal X again. \n\n\n---\n\n### Results\n\n#### Test tables:\n\n**Charge-step one** (Start-step of 20 minutes)\n\n|Item|Original Charge|Total Charge|Time|Notes|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|A1|1322MJ|1328 	Megajoules|19:57 minutes:seconds|*Stable charge.*|\n|A2|1663MJ|1666	Megajoules|20:02 minutes:seconds|*Largest successful sample by size, great charge.*|\n|A3|1054MJ|1059 	Megajoules|20:04 minutes:seconds|*Stable Charge.*|\n|A4|1684MJ|1397 	Megajoules|13:49 minutes:seconds|*Unstable charge, had to abort early to avoid rapid discharge.*|\n|A5|1097MJ|1108 	Megajoules|23:13 minutes:seconds|*Most stable charge, was able to keep a continous charge for longer.*|\n\n**Charge-step two** (+20 minutes)\n\n|Item|Original Charge|Total Charge|Time|Notes|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|B1|1575MJ|1583 	Megajoules|42:27 minutes:seconds| *Charge became unstable after passing the 40-minute mark.*|\n|B2|1306MJ|1313 	Megajoules|41:02 minutes:seconds|*Stable charge.*|\n|B3|1722MJ|1642 	Megajoules|28:34 minutes:seconds|*Unstable charge, had to abort early.*|\n|B4|1519MJ|1542 	Megajoules|41:00 minutes:seconds|*Stable charge.* |\n|B5|801MJ|884 	Megajoules|47:00 minutes:seconds|*Kept itself stable and allowed for a charge considerably larger than it's original amount.* |\n\n**Charge-step three**  (+20 minutes)\n\n|Item|Original Charge|Total Charge|Time|Notes|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|C1|1363MJ|1502 		Megajoules|62:27 minutes:seconds|Only successful charge.

I've concluded from my experiments is that the Stellar Fragments can allow for a recharge after it's naturally degraded. From what I could tell, each fragment that successfully recharged was capable of the same things as a non-recharged fragment. It bodes well to the potential for creating tools dependent on another type of energy than photon-power, which is the current standard.\nProceeding from this, I believe that the course of action would be expanding the operation and recruiting more researchers. The potential of this technology is extraordinary.\n\n---\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nMany thanks to [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) for helping me gather enough research samples to begin and finish this paper. \n(The expedition log can be found by clicking [**This**](SubIndexes/Logs/finishedlogs/Expeditions/DesertExpedition.md).)\n\n\n",title:"Stellar Fragments"},"/SubIndexes/Logs/finishedlogs/SocialRP/NoraAndYumesakiChatAboutRetem.":{content:'---\ntitle: "Nora and Yumesaki chat about Retem!"\n---\n\n#### Participants: *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) and [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)*\n\n\n#### Place: [Retem](SubIndexes/Places/Retem/Retem.md)]\n\n#### Participants: [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) and [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md).\n\n#### Place(s): [Halpha](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md), [Central City](SubIndexes/Places/Aelio/CentralCity.md), by the café \u0026 Retem Bridge.\n\n**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Oh Hiya **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**!"\n\n**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) greets back, slightly muffled**:	"Hey Yumyum!~"\n\n**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"So what\'s up with you?"\n\n**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) takes off her mask**: "Well, I\'ve got an assignment by the commander - to go to Retem."\n\n**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Oh yeah?
