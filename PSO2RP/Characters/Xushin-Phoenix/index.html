Tags:\n- #Story\n- #SugarKitty\n- #SliceOfLife\n- #Introductions\n### (ooc: 2021-10-07)\n\n#### Clara walks up to a pleasant looking lady who seems to be in thought.\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):** "Hey there..."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You need something?"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I- uh... I don\'t know."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You don\'t know. *Hmmph*. You\'re not \'new\' are you?"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Uhm, define new?"\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Nevermind." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said,* "Hello to you too."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She bowed lightly:* "Good to meet you, miss...?"\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"*[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)*. Science division."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"*[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)*?~ That\'s a nice name."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Hmm... Yours?"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"My name\'s *[Clara](Characters/Clara.md)*, ms. *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)*."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"*[Clara](Characters/Clara.md)*, that too is a nice name." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said, pulling up her console.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Oh? Thank you." *She noticed the console and proceeded to ask:* "What are you doing there?"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She walked up behind [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) and peered over her shoulder:* "Hm."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Nothing really." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said,* "Just looking over relevant data."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*It was data from the last urgent quest. She was compiling numbers.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Right, you were with the science division." She look confused at the data: "What are you analyzing?"\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Combat records, so we can keep track of the opposition\'s numbers."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It allows us to prepare ourselves next time."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I see. Anything conclusive?"\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"We\'re seeing more Pettax grade DOLLS going after the mining rigs."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It\'s been steadily growing, the average that is."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"What about the median?" *She responded slightly teasingly.*\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You\'ll see it all in a viewscreen somewhere."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Hm, okay." *Suddenly her stomach audibly growled and nervously she said:* "You don\'t happen to know where I could get a meal?"\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... How long have you lived in this city?" *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) asked [Clara](Characters/Clara.md).*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Uh, well, I got here today."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"So you ARE new. Are you registered with ARKS?"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Yeah! I fought some terrifying three-headed monster."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You\'re new and you went against a Nex? Not TOO bad. Come on." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md): said, dismissing her console and walking.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Oh! Okay."\n\n#### The two walked over to the café.  \n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"This is the café. You can get something to eat here."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Ah I see, would you perhaps like to join me for a meal? First day and all." *She anxiously leered over at the bar-disk.*\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... ... I suppose so." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said, walking under the disk-like roof with a sigh.*\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) looked to [Clara](Characters/Clara.md)*. "What do you want?"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Some sort of food." *She responded anxiously, at a loss of words.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*[Clara](Characters/Clara.md) stood behind [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):, almost hiding from the bar-maid\'s glare:* "Could you, uh.. possibly order for me?"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She ran off to hide behind a tree:* "You\'ve, uh.. got this...!"\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n	\u003cimg width="600" src="C:\\Users\\edvin\\Documents\\ObsidianVaults\\PSO2RP\\Images\\Clara\\Clara1.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"What the Hell are..." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) frowned at the woman, and scoffed.* "Two shrimp spring roll plates and two teas."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*The bar-maid responds*: "Of course, take a seat over there."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Thanks." *she moved to sit.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*[Clara](Characters/Clara.md): carefully moved to the table where [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md): was sat.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"T..- thanks... for ordering..."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Sit here"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"O- okay."\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	She took a seat, gracefully.\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n	\u003cimg width="600" src="C:\\Users\\edvin\\Documents\\ObsidianVaults\\PSO2RP\\Images\\Clara\\Clara2.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... What got into you? Why the sudden shyness?"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Uh, ergh... well, I just get really like, scared almost, talking to people."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... You talked to me just fine earlier."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"W- well, you looked nice to talk to, you get what I mean?"\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... You felt comfortable around me due to my appearance?"\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Sort of, more-so your... aura? I don\'t know how to explain it."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Aura. Interesting." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said,* "Perhaps it\'s my photon affinity."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Photon affinity?"\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Or rather, photon aptitude. Having a high photon aptitude means that I am able to control photons far better than others."\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Those with a high photon aptitude can also have this... aura surrounding them."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I assume there\'s some sort of \'but\' coming after that."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It CAN be dangerous. If I have a higher photon aptitude, but my body is unable to withstand the stress it brings..."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It can be bad."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Guess you\'ve gotta be able to control \'em photons real good, eh...?" She joked, attempting to raise the mood.\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"I do. My body must be treated like a temple if I am to keep my own photons from burning me from the inside."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I want to say that\'s rather dark, though I\'d be lying as photons are rather bright."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*Pretty soon, their food would come. Each woman got two shrimp spring rolls with lines of peanut sauce drizzled over them.*\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*They also each got iced tea, sweetened carefully as to not be too overwhelming.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She awed at the food and drinks that were infront of the two.*\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*They could see there were three shrimps on top of the spring rolls, just under the clear wrapping. [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) took one and bit into it. There was a satisfying crunch to it from the vegetables.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*[Clara](Characters/Clara.md) looked as [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) ate the roll and brought forth her shaking hand to grab a roll aswell.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	She took a bite and her eyes lit up: "This..."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"This is amazing."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It\'s good. Don\'t worry." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said. The newman may not realize it, but her voice was also very calming.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Mm-hm!" *She responded now, having a mouth full of spring rolls.*\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):** shook her head and enjoyed her\'s as a respectable pace.\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"STh-is-... ishch... so... gswawhood..." *She said and quickly realizing that her mouth was full. She embarrassingly looked down at her plate to avoid eye contact.*\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Aelio seafood can\'t be beat." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said, finishing one of her rolls.* \n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Mhm, though I don\'t know if that\'s my hunger speaking. Haven\'t had food all day."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You can\'t go without eating." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)* said. "Eat until you\'re full."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"It\'s been an eventful day, to say the least. Thank you for the food~" \n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):** responded, taking another bite and a sip-\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	of the iced tea.\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"No problem." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said, getting to her second spring roll. They were rather big, able to fill up small bellies.*\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"If you don\'t mind me asking, how\'d you end up in this place? I assume through the \'big-space-pod-thing\'?\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... ... Yeah."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"...how long have you been here?"\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"More than a decade. I came here as a child."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Oh man."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Is coming as a child common here?"\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It isn\'t."\n\n**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Must\'ve been lonely."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It was." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)* said, "But I had people to look after me."\n\n**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	She finished her springrolls, and sipped her tea.

When she can be bothered to cooperate with other ARKS, she can best be described as a loyal and determined ally, although she tends to vanish as quickly as she arrives. Despite this, she\'s a reasonable comrade, able to cooperate for long enough periods and comport herself respectfully. It\'s clear that she has more compassion for the dead than the living, which is not to say she is dispassionate to her peers, it is more that she sees death as an inevitability and must thusly have her peers give it a merry chase first.\n\nBecause of her tendency to skirt the razor\'s edge and take deadly risks to keep her comrades alive, she\'s garnered a reputation as some sort of unkillable, taciturn revenant that fulfills her tasks with ruthless efficiency and then disappears. It\'s implied she\'s not even aware of her tendency to save lives, shrugging off thanks with a simple "Well, you were alive when I found you, so..." and trailing off, only to once again make her way to the next emergency, only giving pause to give the dead their due and offer parting words.\n\nThe truth is simple, and perhaps sadder. The Custodian is a deeply troubled woman haunted by delusions of ghostly figures she cannot recognize and is bothered even further by the fact that she was chosen. This leaves her unable to sleep and thus having to fight in order to placate these "ghosts." The lack of a sleep cycle leaves her irritable, and just self-aware enough that she shuts up and replies in a veneer of an even temper in order to avoid alienating her allies, and due to her superior fighting instincts is able to function even in her sleep deprived state, dozing off while \'dormant\' with one eye open and keeping her distance so others don\'t realize that her delusions are throwing her into a downward spiral, which rises to the surface when pushed beyond what her rational mind can handle and she lashes out.\n\nThe Custodian typically ensures one day of true dormancy per thirty, resupplying and minimizing labour in order to recuperate in vain hopes that she can reclaim the vestiges of her humanity, though more often than not she is forced to act. This is often the times when her true self slips out, an educated citizen turned rampaging war engine due to her circumstance\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n***\u003cp align="center"\u003e(Source: Slightly edited version of  \u003ca href="https://www.guilded.gg/PSO2NGS-RPC/groups/QzRJ45qz/channels/af8cd38e-eb2c-467d-bc6b-1f648e24773f/forums/2053512714"\u003ePSO2 New Genesis RP Guilded Database.\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e***\n',title:"Anora Casan"},"/PSO2RP/Characters/Equinox":{content:'```markdown\n\ntitle: "Anora Casan"\n\n```\n\n\u003ch1  align="center" style="color: #ffffff; font-family:pso2_font; font-size:50px;"\u003eEquinox\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1 align="center"\u003eEquinox\u003c/h1\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n#### Tags:\n- #Character\n- #ThePatrons\n\n%%```ad-quote\ntitle: \'\'Insert quote here.\'\' \n```%%\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n	\u003cimg width="300" src="file:///C:/Users/edvin/Documents/ObsidianVaults/PSO2RP/Images/Equinox/equinox1.jpg"\u003e 	\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n```ad-summary\ntitle: Personality and details\ncollapse: open\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003ePersonality:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nEquinox shows basic emotion around others while her Light Personality is in control and finds it incredibly difficult to trust people other than Nox(Dark Personality) and she rather that she keep to herself so that past events don’t repeat themselves.

As tradition with the rest of the family at birth, they were tested for compatibility with Photons in which they were to be taught how to use when they became of age, which they were both found to be highly compatible. Regardless of the questionable activities, she never questioned it as she didn’t think it was her place and so she carried on with life as normal until a series of unfortunate events occurred that changed her life forever.  \n  \nOn Equinox\'s 16th birthday, due to her family business that had operated in a less than ethical manner for over a decade, members of the family and any associated with them were at risk of being targeted by groups that wanted to see justice for their actions. Regrettably, she had witnessed an assassination first hand and was left alive to send a message to the rest family.  \n  \nThe group had targeted her best friend\'s family who had many dealings with her own. It was a birthday like any other, Equinox was spoiled and pampered by her family like every birthday before and her best friends was invited to celebrate with her. However, regardless of the occasion, the day turned out to be one of the worst in her life with her best friend being murdered in front of her. They were in the process of making their way to the dining room with her best friend\'s parents, her own parents and sister already there, to finally cut the cake when multiple masked assailants had burst through the windows, instantly taking down her friend\'s parents with swift strikes to their throats, their bodies hitting the floor with a thud.  \n  \nThe assailants then restrained the two girls and a knife was brought to her friends neck. “Remember this day, for this is what will happen to the rest of you” were the words she would remember forever before the assailant had dramatically cut her friends throat in a straight, clean line, her life instantly draining from her eyes. Equinox had wanted to scream, but her voice could not find its way from her throat. She had just sat there stiffly while the assassin made their clean escape until her own parents had eventually found her within the tragedy, surrounded with puddles of blood and a blank look in her eyes.  \n  \nShe felt herself break that day.  \n  \nIt took about 3 months after the assassination before her split personality became apparent. Constant whispers within her head consisting of dark thoughts became very prominent and while she tried to ignore them, they plagued her sleep as well. It eventually came to the fateful day where life got even worse than she thought it could.  \n  \nShe had been on her way to her sister\'s room to find some comfort from these dark thoughts, however on her way there, for no apparent reason, she had blacked out. When she had finally regained consciousness, she had found herself in her destination but instead of comfort, she found horror and sorrow. There was her sister, with a stab wound through her chest in place of her heart and to make matters worse, Equinox had looked down to see the murder weapon in her hand still fresh with blood. She was found soon after by her family, completely frozen in place and tears streaming down her face.  \n  \nIt was the very next day in which she not only was diagnosed with split personalities with her vague recount of what had happened and revealing she had been hearing voices in her head, but was also banished from the family due to the acts she had committed with the only promise of nothing being said. She had later figured this was likely to keep the families image up in the world of their business.  \n  \nShe had lived on the streets for a while, trusting no one but herself and with this came familiarity with the voice in her head which she had dubbed Nox and who in turn had called her Light. From talking with Nox, she had found they were polar opposites. Where she was calm and collected, Nox was aggressive and rough. Due to their symbiotic bond and the passing months, they formed a bond out of necessity to survive and because of this, Nox had dialled in her violent tendencies and promised that she wouldn\'t force control if she was let out once in awhile which they found to be possible by manipulating the Photons inside them.  \n  \nTo survive the months alone, they had mainly worked at sketchier businesses that didn\'t care for her age and were in need of labour. This work had mostly been left to Nox who found it easier to adapt to the hard work as well as the fact she found she had an innate need to protect Light from any further suffering in the world.  \n  \nThey had spent about 9 months of doing this before she decided they wanted to do something more with her life, perhaps by utilising their high compatibility for Photons. So on her 17th birthday, she applied to ARKs as a potential recruit and before long, they had been taking part in the ARKs training course. She had been required to disclose her split personality during her training which had prompted the ARKs counsellors, as well their scientists, to thoroughly evaluate her to make sure she was fit to be an operative and how she was able to enable the switch along with the changes in appearance for each personality. After thorough testing, Equinox had been approved for further training and due to her unique circumstances, had been given two specialities. Nox had found to be the perfect fit for an assassin, which she had thought to be ironic considering how she had been created, whereas Light was found to be highly efficient as a healer with her need to stop anymore suffering within her life.  \n  \nThey worked their way through the ranks for the next 3 years, eventually becoming a well known operative throughout the ships for her unbreakable resolve to see every mission through and their stellar record for sustaining no casualties in any of their missions. They had also learned to further utilise their unique condition to the point they could now change their clothes when switching the personality in control, allowing for instantaneous response if a mission hadn\'t gone to plan. Equinox had become a very dependable Operative through the years enabling her the privilege of being acquainted with the upper Echelons of ARKs leading to her being sanctioned to the Council of Six as a specialist in her craft and candidate for any missions that were deemed confidential or too high a risk for other ARKs Operatives.\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n***\u003cp align="center"\u003e(Source: slightly altered information from \u003ca href="https://equinox-pso2.carrd.co/"\u003ehttps://equinox-pso2.carrd.co/\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e***\n',title:"Anora Casan"},"/PSO2RP/Characters/Gaia Stellaria":{content:'```markdown\n\ntitle: "Anora Casan"\n\n```\n\n\u003ch1 align="center" style="color: #B871FF; font-family:pso2_font; font-size:50px;"\u003eGaia Stellaria\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1 align="center"\u003eGaia Stellaria\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n#### Tags:\n- #Character\n- #ThePatrons\n\n```ad-quote\ntitle: \'\'I don\'t know what I am doing, just making stuff up as I go and I am pretty good at that.\'\' \n```\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n	\u003cimg width="600" src="file:///C:/Users/edvin/Documents/ObsidianVaults/PSO2RP/Images/Gaia/Gaia1.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n```ad-summary\ntitle: Personality and details\ncollapse: open\n\n%%\u003ch4 align="center"\u003ePersonality:\u003c/h4\u003e%%\n\n\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003eDetails:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n- \u003cb\u003eName:\u003c/b\u003e Tianea \'Gaia\' Stellaria \n- \u003cb\u003eRace:\u003c/b\u003e Self gene-spliced Newman \n- \u003cb\u003eHeight:\u003c/b\u003e 180 cms \n- \u003cb\u003eAge:\u003c/b\u003e 30 years old (as of episode 5)\n- \u003cb\u003eGender:\u003c/b\u003e Woman\n- \u003cb\u003eOccupation/Archetype:\u003c/b\u003e Explorer, Scientist, Engineer, Recon  \n- \u003cb\u003eWeaponry:\u003c/b\u003e Generally equipped with a prototype she made herself.

Tianea lived a rather secluded existence at home while her parents were away on assignments for prolonged periods.  \n  \nShe was shy and reserved, but very studious and had a strong will to learn about anything that interested her. Mainly studying from home, she had above average grades, which could\'ve been better if she had any interest in her subjects.  \n\nMedical Reports salvaged from her origin ship state she had some vitamin and mineral deficiencies and this was why she was mostly at home, which made her fragile and susceptible to sickness.  \n  \nYears passed and while she kept her grades on above-average, but not the highest they could\'ve been, she had started studying biology at home on the side, using plants. She managed to create a remedy for her deficiencies and solved many of her innate issues.  \n  \nSaid medicine only seemed to work on herself, indicating some variable that only matched with herself.  \n\nWhen she turned 16, tragedy struck. Her ship was one of the victims in a falspawn attack. Tianeas parents had quickly managed to have Tianea evacuated to another ship through their pilot contacts. Tianea  had to leave it all behind in a rush, given only an \'\'emergency package\'\' of stuff to bring with her to Thorn.  \n\nAs the shuttle took off, Tianea watched as her neighborhood collapsed into a massive cloud of dust and debris. When she arrived on Thorn, she was hurried off with no directions or any idea what to do. She was not sure if her parents were coming for her, but she assumed the best and waited near the Gate she had been dropped at.  \n  \nDays passed, no one had come for her. No one seemed to even have noticed she had been dropped off. Perhaps her shy and secluded nature removed her presence and made her invisible.  \n  \nThe last actual account of Tianea at this point was that she had disappeared into the city and vanished, with her emergency package in hand.  \nThis was also the last time she ever called herself Tianea.  \n  \n  \nYears passed and Gaia, as a nickname of sorts, had appeared in some dark alleys and rumours mentioning someone in an abandoned wing dealing with custom machinery, cast parts and making performance drugs.  \n\nThis would prove to be Tianea, still researching, building and producing whatever she felt interested in and had the ability to work with.  \n  \nSometime after disappearing, Gaia had discovered a small photonic aptitude which she was capable of using as a supplement to her machinery and science. Also how she made medicine that only worked on herself, she had discovered.  \n\nShe had also managed to pass ARKS training and become a member, both as a researcher and a soldier.  \n  \nToday, she still offers custom tech services, both within engineering and biotech. She is also offering a selection of medicines and drugs, some which she donates to ARKS as a means of contributing.  \nSomewhere between then and now, she has managed to splice her own DNA with that of dragons, causing her to sprout horns and tail, among other generally reptilian traits and also strengthening her body, curing herself of her frailness.\n\n\n```\n\n\n***\u003cp align="center"\u003e(Source: Slightly edited version of \u003ca href="https://www.guilded.gg/PSO2NGS-RPC?i=AQ9OLk0A\u0026cid=af8cd38e-eb2c-467d-bc6b-1f648e24773f\u0026intent=forum"\u003ePSO2 New Genesis RP Guilded Database\u003c/a\u003e and\u003ca src="https://tianea.carrd.co/"\u003e https://tianea.carrd.co/\u003c/a\u003e ) \u003c/p\u003e***',title:"Anora Casan"},"/PSO2RP/Characters/Gogo":{content:'```markdown\n\ntitle: "Anora Casan"\n\n```\n\n\u003ch1 align="center" style="color: #ffe596; font-family:pso2_font; font-size:50px;"\u003eGogo Mes\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1 align="center"\u003eGogo Mes\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n#### Tags:\n- #Character\n- #ThePatrons\n\n```ad-quote\ntitle: \'\'If you have an issue with something, you can count on me!A"\n```\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n	\u003cimg width="600" src="C:\\Users\\edvin\\Documents\\ObsidianVaults\\PSO2RP\\Images\\Gogo\\Gogo (1).png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n```ad-summary\ntitle: Personality and details\ncollapse: open\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003ePersonality:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nInsert personality here.\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003eDetails:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n- \u003cb\u003eName:\u003c/b\u003e Gogo Mes\n- \u003cb\u003eRace:\u003c/b\u003e Raptor\n- \u003cb\u003eHeight:\u003c/b\u003e 168 cms\n- \u003cb\u003eAge:\u003c/b\u003e 20 years old\n- \u003cb\u003eGender:\u003c/b\u003e Woman\n- \u003cb\u003eOccupation%%/Archetype%%:\u003c/b\u003e Guard on home planet.\n- \u003cb\u003eWeaponry:\u003c/b\u003e Dual-wielding guns.\n- \u003cb\u003ePronouns:\u003c/b\u003e She/They\n\n```\n\n```ad-summary\ntitle: About Gogo\ncollapse: open\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003eBackground:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nShe\'s the girlfriend of [Lilit](Characters/Lilit.md).\n\n\n```\n\n```ad-note\ntitle: Artworks!\ncollapse: open\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n\u003cimg width="600" src="file:///C:\\Users\\edvin\\Documents\\ObsidianVaults\\PSO2RP\\Images\\Gogo\\gogowaa.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003eBy: \u003ca href="https://twitter.com/MantisPray2"\u003e@MantisPray2\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n\u003cimg width="600" src="file:///C:\\Users\\edvin\\Documents\\ObsidianVaults\\PSO2RP\\Images\\Gogo\\huggg.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003eBy: \u003ca href="https://twitter.com/MantisPray2"\u003e@MantisPray2\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n\u003cimg width="600" src="file:///C:\\Users\\edvin\\Documents\\ObsidianVaults\\PSO2RP\\Images\\Gogo\\kabedon.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003eBy: \u003ca href="https://twitter.com/MantisPray2"\u003e@MantisPray2\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n\u003cimg width="600" src="file:///C:\\Users\\edvin\\Documents\\ObsidianVaults\\PSO2RP\\Images\\Gogo\\themtmmm.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003eBy: \u003ca href="https://twitter.com/MantisPray2"\u003e@MantisPray2\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n\u003cimg width="600" src="file:///C:\\Users\\edvin\\Documents\\ObsidianVaults\\PSO2RP\\Images\\Gogo\\themtwhem.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003eBy: \u003ca href="https://twitter.com/MantisPray2"\u003e@MantisPray2\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n\u003cimg width="600" src="file:///C:\\Users\\edvin\\Documents\\ObsidianVaults\\PSO2RP\\Images\\Gogo\\women.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003eBy: \u003ca href="https://twitter.com/MantisPray2"\u003e@MantisPray2\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n```\n\n***\u003cp align="center"\u003e(Source: \u003ca\u003eMe!

Her pod was found in the shallows of Halphia Lake. She awoke surrounded by water, and under a sparkling night sky and bright full moon. Having no name, she would be called \'Lumina\' for the way her skin and hair seemed to stand out in the moonlight, characteristics similar to a fictional princess of the moon bearing the same name. At first, ARKS was unsure why a child would be a meteorn, but when they were ambushed by dolls while taking her to Central City, the girl instinctively grabbed a dropped rod from the ground and defended herself and the others with lightning. They had no other questions for her authenticity after that, but they did wonder why she claimed ignorance over what she did. She seemed scared after the fact. She had no idea what she had done.\n\nShe spent several years in Central City, having immediately gone into training for ARKS the first year. She became a model candidate for Force training, and dazzled everyone with her quick ascension through the grades. Essentially, she was raised by ARKS. But her distant and sometimes pretentious personality made her a target for bullies. This caused her to see the futility in friends, and she grew to prefer her own company over others. She had many other problems that she is unwilling to speak about.\n\nLumina became a very beautiful, very tall young woman, consequently placing her on a very high shelf for romantics. Her skills and photon pool have also grown with her, making her one of the stronger young ARKS in the city. She chose to develop herself further in an academic sense, and began training as a photon technician.\n\nCurrently, she can be found mulling over technology in Central City, or spending time out on the field for trials and general relaxation. Though the latter is more uncommon, as she is always very busy with her work, and her own intellectual pursuits.\n```\n\n```ad-quote\ntitle: "It was insane seeing a skinny little kid struggle to lift a rod twice her height, and completely fry a doll ten times her size.

Despite being a useful teammate in a fight, Molly is reckless, loud, immature and... lacking in the brains department, but her impulsive nature makes her quick to improvise in the heat of combat.\n\nThe creator of her strange armaments was a mystery, but a note found tucked into one of her gloves on impact seems to give the girl a clear hint as to who it was.

These days, [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) is hard at work to rebuild his account, so he can afford all the cute outfits and weapons he wants. *Really, have you seen these market prices?*\n\n```\n\n\n\n```ad-summary\ntitle: Familial connections\ncollapse: closed\n\nYazad adopted both [Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md) and [Nora Honora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md) after [The Housing Crisis](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md#^567dfe).\n\n```\n\n***\u003cp align="center"\u003e(Source: Slightly edited version of \u003ca href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bZtS4z9xHEUwiK6__rJnbOgMenmOa7bAmuyE4evxMkk/edit"\u003eYazad/Bahamutia\'s character database\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e***\n\n',title:"Anora Casan"},"/PSO2RP/Characters/Yokai":{content:'```markdown\n\ntitle: "Anora Casan"\n\n```\n\n\u003ch1 align="center" style="color:#a8d8ff; font-family:pso2_font; font-size:50px;"\u003eYokai\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1 align="center"\u003eYokai\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n#### Tags:\n- #Character\n\n```ad-quote\ntitle: \'\'Insert quote here.\'\' \n```\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n	\u003cimg width="600" src=""\u003e --Insert image here--\n	\u003cimg width="600" src=""\u003e --Insert image here--\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n```ad-summary\ntitle: Personality and details\ncollapse: open\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003ePersonality:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nInsert personality here.\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003eDetails:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n- \u003cb\u003eName:\u003c/b\u003e Yokai\n- \u003cb\u003eRace:\u003c/b\u003e Hi-cast Model Type: Yggdrasil, Onsite Kill, Artificial Intelligence.\n- \u003cb\u003eHeight:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert height here in cms-- \n- \u003cb\u003eAge:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert age here--\n- \u003cb\u003eGender:\u003c/b\u003e Woman\n- \u003cb\u003eOccupation/Archetype:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert occupation/Archetype here--\n- \u003cb\u003eWeaponry:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert preferred weaponry here--\n\n\n```\n\n```ad-summary\ntitle: About Yokai\ncollapse: open\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003eBackground:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n--Insert background here--\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n***\u003cp align="center"\u003e(Source: \u003ca href="--insert website source here.com--"\u003e--insert source here--\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e***\n',title:"Anora Casan"},"/PSO2RP/Concepts/Meteorns":{content:'```markdown\n\ntitle: "Anora Casan"\n\n```',title:"Anora Casan"},"/PSO2RP/Places/Halpha":{content:'```markdown\n\ntitle: "Anora Casan"\n\n```\n\n\u003ch1 align="center"\u003eHalpha\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n#### Tags:\n- #Places',title:"Anora Casan"},"/PSO2RP/Places/Sugar Kitty":{content:'```markdown\n\ntitle: "Anora Casan"\n\n```\n\n\u003ch1 align="center" style="color: --insert hex color here--; font-family:pso2_font; font-size:50px;"\u003eSugar Kitty\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1 align="center"\u003eSugar Kitty\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp align="center"\u003eCats out of sugar!\u003cp\u003e\n\n#### Tags:\n- #Places	\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n	\u003cimg width="600" src="file:///C:/Users/edvin/Documents/ObsidianVaults/PSO2RP/Images/Sugar Kitty\\Pie.png"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n',title:"Anora Casan"},"/PSO2RP/Templates/Character Template":{content:'```markdown\n\ntitle: "--insertnamehere--"\n\n```\n\n\u003ch1 align="center" style="color: --insert hex color here--; font-family:pso2_font; font-size:50px;"\u003eName goes here\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1 align="center"\u003eName goes here\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n#### Tags:\n\n- #Character\n\n```ad-quote\ntitle: \'\'Insert quote here.\'\' \n```\n\n\u003cp align="center"\u003e\n	\u003cimg width="600" src=""\u003e --Insert image here--\n	\u003cimg width="600" src=""\u003e --Insert image here--\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n```ad-summary\ntitle: Personality and details\ncollapse: open\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003ePersonality:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\nInsert personality here.\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003eDetails:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n- \u003cb\u003eName:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert name here--\n- \u003cb\u003eRace:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert race here--\n- \u003cb\u003eHeight:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert height here in cms-- \n- \u003cb\u003eAge:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert age here--\n- \u003cb\u003eGender:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert gender here--\n- \u003cb\u003eOccupation/Archetype:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert occupation/Archetype here--\n- \u003cb\u003eWeaponry:\u003c/b\u003e --Insert preferred weaponry here--\n\n\n```\n\n```ad-summary\ntitle: --Insert \'About\' character here--\ncollapse: open\n\n\u003ch4 align="center"\u003eBackground:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n--Insert background here--\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n***\u003cp align="center"\u003e(Source: \u003ca href="--insert website source here.com--"\u003e--insert source here--\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e***',title:"--insertnamehere--"},"/moc/directory":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Quartz Documentation\"\n---\n\n## Setup\nWelcome to Quartz!

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you\'d like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml\nname: Your name here! # Shows in the footer\nenableToc: true # Whether to show a Table of Contents\ndescription: Page description to show to search engines\npage_title: Quartz Example Page # Default Page Title\n\nlinks: # Links to show in footer\n  - link_name: Twitter\n    link: https://twitter.com/_jzhao\n  - link_name: Github\n    link: https://github.com/jackyzha0\n```\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml\nenableLegend: false # automatically generate a legend\nenableDrag: true # allow dragging nodes in the graph\nenableZoom: true # allow zooming and panning the graph\npaths: # colour specific nodes path off of their path\n  - /moc: "#4388cc"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/custom.scss`. If you\'d like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what actually gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo\'s website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).',title:"Configuration"},"/notes/editing":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Editing Content in Quartz\"\n---\n\n## Editing \nQuartz runs on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so all notes are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).\n\n### Obsidian\nI *strongly* recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of my local files.\n\n**🔗 [How to link your Obsidian Vault](notes/obsidian.md)**\n\nOf course, all the files are in Markdown so you could just use your favourite text editor of choice.\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore-notes.md)\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.** This is the home page which is slightly special. You don't need front matter here!\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Ensure that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet. This is *highly recommended*.\n\n👀 [Preview Quartz Changes](notes/preview-changes.md)\n\nFor those who like to live life more on the edge, viewing the garden through Obsidian gets you pretty close to the real thing.\n\n## Publishing Changes\nNow that you know the basics of managing your digital garden using Quartz, you can publish it to the internet!\n\n🌍 [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n\nHaving problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).",title:"Editing Content in Quartz"},"/notes/external-hosting":{content:'---\ntitle: "External Hosting"\n---\n\n\n\n',title:"External Hosting"},"/notes/hosting":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Deploying Quartz to the Web\"\n---\n\n## GitHub Pages\nQuartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! You can head to `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/quartz` to see it live.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](/notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. Set the source to deploy from `master` using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is essentially a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as normal.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. If you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io` (which GitHub gives to you for free!) as your domain.\n\n[Reference.](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\n[Reference.](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n	github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n	publish_dir: ./public  \n	publish_branch: master\n	cname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**! If you are using `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`, you can skip this step.\n\nFor this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).\n\nGitHub has some [documentation on this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but the tldr; is to\n\n1. Go to your forked repository (`github.com/\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e/quartz`) settings page and go to the Pages tab. Under \"Custom domain\", type your custom domain, then click **Save**.\n2. Go to your DNS Provider and create a CNAME record that points from your domain to `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io.` (yes, with the trailing period).\n\n	![Example Configuration for Quartz](/notes/images/google-domains.png)*Example Configuration for Quartz*\n3. Wait 30 minutes to an hour for the network changes to kick in.\n4. Done!\n\n## External Hosting\nDon't want to use GitHub Pages? Hugo builds everything for you! Everything is a packaged set of static files ready to deploy in `/public`. You can then upload this folder to a cloud provider to deploy. Alternatively, most providers also give users the option to link a GitHub repository and a folder to deploy. When doing this, ensure you select `/public` folder under the `master` branch.\n\n---\n\nNow that your Quartz is live, let's figure out how to make Quartz really *yours*!\n\n🎨 [Customizing Quartz](notes/config.md)\n\nHaving problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).",title:"Deploying Quartz to the Web"},"/notes/ignore-notes":{content:'---\ntitle: "Ignoring Notes"\n---\n\n### Quartz Ignore\nEdit `ignoreFiles` in `config.toml` to include paths you\'d like to exclude from being rendered.\n\n```toml\n...\nignoreFiles = [  \n    "/content/templates/*",  \n    "/content/private/*", \n    "\u003cyour path here\u003e"\n]\n```\n\n`ignoreFiles` supports the use of Regular Expressions (RegEx) so you can ignore patterns as well (e.g. ignoring all `.png`s by doing `\\\\.png$`).\n\nMore details in [Hugo\'s documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#ignore-content-and-data-files-when-rendering).\n\n### Global Ignore\nHowever, just adding to the `ignoreFiles` will only prevent the page from being access through Quartz. If you want to prevent the file from being pushed to GitHub (for example if you have a public repository), you need to also add the path to the `.gitignore` file at the root of the repository.',title:"Ignoring Notes"},"/notes/obsidian":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Obsidian Vault Integration\"\n---\n\n## Setup\nObsidian is the preferred way to use Quartz. You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.\n\n### New Vault\nIf you don't have an existing Vault, [download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and create a new Vault in the `/content` folder that you created and cloned during the [setup](notes/setup.md).\n\n### Linking an existing Vault\nThe easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of our files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the `/content` folder.\n\n## Settings\nGreat, now that you have your Obsidian linked to your Quartz, let's fix some settings so that they play well.\n\nUnder Options \u003e Files and Links, set the New link format to always be Absolute Path in Vault and disabled WikiLinks so Obsidian generates regular Markdown links.\n\n![Obsidian Settings](/notes/images/obsidian-settings.png)*Obsidian Settings*\n\n## Templates\nInserting front matter everytime you want to create a new Note gets really annoying really quickly. Luckily, Obsidian supports templates which makes inserting new content really easily.\n\n**If you decide to overwrite the `/content` folder completely, don't remove the `/content/templates` folder!**\n\nHead over to Options \u003e Core Plugins and enable the Templates plugin. Then go to Options \u003e Hotkeys and set a hotkey for 'Insert Template'. That way, when you create a new note, you can just press the hotkey for a new template and be ready to go!",title:"Obsidian Vault Integration"},"/notes/preview-changes":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Preview Changes\"\n---\n\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here's exactly how to do that!\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```shell\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\n$ go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\n$ cd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Scrape all links in your Quartz folder and generate info for Quartz\n$ hugo-obsidian -input=content -output=data -index=true\n```\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. If you'd like to preview your site locally, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).\n\n```\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\n$ cd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\n$ hugo server\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```",title:"Preview Changes"},"/notes/setup":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Setup\"\n---\n\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden. If you're ready to start writing content already, check out the recommended flow for editing notes in Quartz.\n\n✏️ [Editing Notes in Quartz](notes/editing.md)\n\nHaving problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).",title:"Setup"},"/notes/troubleshooting":{content:"---\ntitle: \"Troubleshooting and FAQ\"\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore-notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### Do I need a website already?\nNo! Setting up Quartz means you set up a site too :)\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder. The only caveat is that you should reference them in your Markdown by prefixing it with a `/`.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.yaml` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)",title:"Troubleshooting and FAQ"},"/private/private-note":{content:'---\ntitle: "Private Stuff"\n---\n\nThis page doesn\'t get published!',title:"Private Stuff"},"/templates/post":{content:'---\ntitle: "{{title}}"\n---\n',title:"{{title}}"}};for(const[a,b]of Object.entries(scrapedContent))contentIndex.add(a,b.content);const stopwords=['i','me','my','myself','we','our','ours','ourselves','you','your','yours','yourself','yourselves','he','him','his','himself','she','her','hers','herself','it','its','itself','they','them','their','theirs','themselves','what','which','who','whom','this','that','these','those','am','is','are','was','were','be','been','being','have','has','had','having','do','does','did','doing','a','an','the','and','but','if','or','because','as','until','while','of','at','by','for','with','about','against','between','into','through','during','before','after','above','below','to','from','up','down','in','out','on','off','over','under','again','further','then','once','here','there','when','where','why','how','all','any','both','each','few','more','most','other','some','such','no','nor','not','only','own','same','so','than','too','very','s','t','can','will','just','don','should','now'],highlight=(i,j)=>{const a=15,k=j.split(/\s+/).filter(a=>a!==""),b=i.split(/\s+/).filter(a=>a!==""),f=a=>k.some(b=>a.toLowerCase().includes(b.toLowerCase())),d=b.map(f);let e=0,g=0;for(let b=0;b<Math.max(d.length-a,0);b++){const f=d.slice(b,b+a),c=f.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0);c>e&&(e=c,g=b)}const c=Math.max(g-a,0),h=Math.min(c+2*a,b.length),l=b.slice(c,h).map(a=>{return f(a)?`<span class="search-highlight">${a}</span>`:a}).join(" ").replaceAll('</span> <span class="search-highlight">'," ");return`${c===0?"":"..."}${l}${h===b.length?"":"..."}`},resultToHTML=({url:b,title:c,content:d,term:a})=>{const e=d.split("---")[2],f=removeMarkdown(e),g=highlight(c,a),h=highlight(f,a);return`<div class="result-card" id="${b}">
