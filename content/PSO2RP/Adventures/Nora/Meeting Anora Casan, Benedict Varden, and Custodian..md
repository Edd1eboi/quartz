### (ooc: 2021-10-07)

#### *[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)approached the person at the fountain and said:* "It's nice, isn't it." *while flayling her arms about.*

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	Ben shifts his gaze to the newcomer. "New eye. I'm not actually used to seeing... this."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** "New eye?"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Yes. I lost mine some time ago. Some lesson in here about treating your body right."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	Taking a more calm stance; she replies: "Sorry to hear that, what happened if you don't mind me asking?"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I'd really prefer not to get into it. I don't like talking about work off the clock."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"That's quite alright. I forgot to introduce myself, the name's *[Nora Honora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):*~"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"*[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md)*, I'm an ARKS operative if the markings didn't give me away."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** "Pleasure to meet you, and I assumed that you were~" 

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I haven't done field ops as part of my job for a long time, though. These days I just provide training for the younger	generation. I might not look like it, but I've been at this for a long time."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Oh, how long?"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Long enough that I can't remember my arrival."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**: *Limona was surely heading to the residential block before noticing two familiar figures.* "Hello!"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Oh dear." *She sighed:* "I came here a couple of months ago." 

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She waves when they look at her.*

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	Noticing Limona behind her, *[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)* says: "Oh heya Limmie!"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Lim. What's up, kiddo?" He doesn't move at all, simply shifting his weight in a smoother manner than he usually did.

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"I hope you both doing well !"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I'm doing quite alright. And you, Limmie?"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I'm just calibrating the new kit. I'm not used to sensory giving me so much useless data."
**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Incidentally, never get a prosthetic body, kiddos."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"I am good thank you, was coming back to my flat, need to continue on my project."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I see, good luck on your project Limmie~"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Thank you very much."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"You changed a part, something?"



**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"More 'fixed the utter disaster that was my old kit.'"
**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Fixing weight distribution caused heat regulation to fail, fixing that through my balancing off... so I'd go weld a plate-
**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	to shut off the warning light. Which would cause me to vent plasma into what's left of my legs."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"That's sounds complicated and painful."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):** "I see it was relatively in hurry. "*She nods at the answers of Varden even he not sees her.*

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"The augments used to rebuild me were ancient even by the time I was running around with what I presume were your grandparents, *[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)*." *He chortles.*

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I wouldn't know, I came here out of one of the pods~"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I was giving an idea for how long I've been active. But I've been kind of like this gross stew entombed in a doll."
**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Perpetually too old for this nonsense."* He chuckles.*

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"A stew?" *She replied with a raised eyebrow.*

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"This isn't my real face. It's plastics."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*Looks concerned by what the man says.*

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Is it a reconstruction of your real face or is it altered?"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"You don't want to see my face."
**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"But I'd presume so. No point in pretending to be someone else, since I'm totally a Meteorn with no recollection of anything beyond fifty years or so or whatever."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"That's concerning."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"It's perfect. I can be whoever I want to be."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I'd assume it comes with pros and cons."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Honestly, it's a weight off my shoulders."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"If you're happy with it then I guess there's no cause for worry."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I mean, big picture I'm not a happy person. But if my scientific pursuits help this generation win, I can be content."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Yes in least it looks good one you !"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Right now I'm just focusing on my experiments."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Experiments, eh? What kind?"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Mostly support software to help ARKS on the field, since the Halphan technological base is comparatively-

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	primitive. I'm working on gear to reach parity."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I see, that's a noble goal."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"One that is seeing production in Cygnus has a small overlay that shows everyone feeds from body-cameras."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"You design elemental weapons we get regularly?"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Nah, I haven't done armstech in a long time."
**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I built a brick with a barrel out of ship plating. I'm never gonna top that, so why try, you know?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Are the body-cameras beneficial to research in combat? I know a lady who'd be interested in that."

**Freddy**:	"So you're the Doc I've heard about."
**Freddy**:	"It's nice to meet you."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I'm not a doctor, do not let me anywhere near a surgical venue."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She slowly turns back when hearing a new voice. And says with a small wave.* "Hello."

**Freddy**:	"The name's Freddy."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"That's a nice name."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Glad to meet you."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Ben, pleasure to meet you."

**Freddy**:	*Looks at everyone*. "So are all our memories gone?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I suppose so."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I can't remember a thing."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Atleast not before the crash."

**Freddy**:	"I know my name and that I'm an ARKs defender."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I joined ARKs when I got here and I barely remembered my name, the name being *[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)*."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I mean... the brain's an interesting thing. Every bit of data you process fires off neurons that generate new proteins."
**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"But I don't know how to restore those pathways. I wouldn't be of much use to you, I'm afraid."

**Freddy**:	"Hmm, okay." 

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Meteorn sometime recover fragments of their memory with the time."

**Freddy**:	"Any ideas on what those dolls are?"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Nobody here seems to known or would share if they know."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I haven't turned up any conclusive data. The ones that end up on my table usually disappate long before I can cut open the body. And I haven't figured out a reliable way to keep them alive."
**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I'm not actually a doctor. Or even a scientist. I just like doing really weird messed up things that make me go: *'man, I really shouldn't have done that.'*"

**Freddy**:	"May I stay to listen to your discussion?"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"You are welcome to." 

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Hey, if you get something useful out of my ramblings, more power to you."

**Freddy**:	"Well, thank you."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Is there any way to get samples from them? Or do they just evaporate aswell?"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Lydia can usually transport them by stunning them into oblivion and beating the tar out of them in transit."

**Freddy**:	"They seem to just roam with no direction."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I'm trying to swear less."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Tar..."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Wait, what if there was an element that slowed their disapperation, like tar?"
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"You could attempt to capture those small guys jumping about."

**Freddy**:	"They tend to break out or draw larger dolls."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Lydia is incredible, the photon reactor I have is her creation."

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"I mean, it's certainly feasible but I'd need time to develop the tech, get a working test type... there's steps."

**Freddy**: "I'd field-test your weapons, if you'd like?"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"It's still a matter of building 'em, Fred. We're looking at a few months of development, minimum."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I see."

**Freddy**:	"It's a good idea."
**Freddy**:	"I discovered the minerals in aelio are common near water sources."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"It's possibly that they either form near the water because of dehydration or because of erosion eating away the dirt and revealing the minerals."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"They're are also in caves."

##### *[Ben](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md) idly taps something in the air.* "And that was an alarm. I've got a date. We'll be in touch." *He said, proceeding to leave the area.*

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"See you Benny~"

**[Benedict Varden](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md):**	"Don't... don't call me that."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Anyway, bye Benny."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"See you later!"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Hello there."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Hello !" *She waves happily.*

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** :	"Hello Tree Creature."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I think I recognize you, but I can't recall your name."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** :	"**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** . *Aaaaand* you're *[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):*, right?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"That's right. Nice to meet you again *[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md)* ."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Sort of funny that we've got similar names." She said as she chuckled lightly.

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"[Anora Casan](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md)  ?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** :	"Expendable."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Expendable?"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"It was since long time I am happy to see you again !"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** : "I mean. While we're full-naming me."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I suppose I should go ahead with my full name; *[Nora Honora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)*~"

#### The call for the ARKs defenders to prepare for deployment rang out.

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She hear the call.* "It seems like we should get going soon."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Might be a good time for me to get the café ready~"

##### Buster joins in out of nowhere and yells:
**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):** "Ah *YEAH*!"

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Yo! You guys comin' for this?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Bustie!"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** :	"I mean, I could find an excuse to find a private little corner and start a massacre."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I've got to attend to the cafe, but do swing by~"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Hello!" *She waves to Buster*

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Gotcha! I'll be back after the op in that case! Yo, Lemon!"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Someone want party?"

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Sure, throw me in the mix."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	*[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md)  idly twirls out her rifle and loads up a bunch of specialized munitions with malicious intent.*

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md)**	"Time to rip and tear, baby!"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"*[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)* we see you after that I assume?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Yep! At the cafe~"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Ok we have still ten minutes before the deployment."

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"What aboutchu', gun gal?"


**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"Alright, mate. We're gonna be bloodletting and bloodshedding together. So who are you?" *She eyes Buster.*

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"It's my brotha!~"  *She pats him.*

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	*He perks up at the pat.* "Hmm--since when'd you finally settle into that?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** *With a certain distaste to his question she simply states:* "He's adopted."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	She clears her throat. "Defender *[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md)*  Casan Expendable, Partisan Squad, Menace One-Five."

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):** Ignoring Nora, he continues:	"Oh, okay, she's formal~"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"Nah. We're on the clock. Gotta give my best."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Yazad would like that~"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"Yazad's... way too formal for my tastes."

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	He rubs at his head idly. "Plus I think he's married."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I like the old man's formality~"

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"That's...the weird part. I never got why he's so young-lookin'."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Genetics perhaps?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	*[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md), after a lengthy lock and load and presses the foregrip to her chin to crack her neck.*

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"Oh, Dad?"

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Eh? What?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**  clams up.
**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"Oh, Someone else."


**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"He adopted me and Bustie~"


**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She smiles at the nickname.*

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"R-right..."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"I'm confused."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"Nothing. I know someone else who's ancient but doesn't look very old at all."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Oh, Benny?"

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Yeah, Benny?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"He was just here~"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"And he presumably bounced to go do really weird fucked up science shit?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"He said something about a date."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"I think that's cap, *[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)*."
**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"I think you're lyin' to me."
**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"I don't think that's *accreat*."

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"I eh...huh?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"*Cap*? I didn't know my statement was a headdress."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Why would I lie?"

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"So she's Benny's kid?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"Eh. Kind of. I'm a war orphan."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Worphan."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"Bruh."

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Yikes, chief."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** *[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md) chuckled at her contraction.*
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Aren't most people here orphans?"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*Limona takes it more seriously, visibly.*

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"No, I'm pretty sure I was raised past childhood by my folks."

#### The call for the ARKs defenders to deploy rang out.

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Oop--guess we gotta boogie woogie!"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** 	"What time is it? It's go time!"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Okay, we have top are you ready?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):**	"Good luck on your mission, come back unscathed please~"

**[Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Ready!"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"See you after, *[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)*."


#### Nora walks to the café and proceeds to cleans and prepares the café for use. Some time later the group returns.

**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"A perfect friggin' conclusion!"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Hey guys! Did it go well?~"

**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"S-ranked that sumbiatch! *Ha-HAH!*"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Good job you both, you did great !" *She says enthustiastically.*

**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Good freakin' hustle!"


**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"That's great to hear, and everyone's alright?"

**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Not a scratch~."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	*[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md)* idly slams her fist into a crack in her torso plating. "Took a hit but I hit back harder."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"We must celebrate this with pie!"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"No problem for me, I will run my dailies maintenance after the next emergency."

**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Aww hell yeah...oh yeah, you two. Didn'tcha get yourself some cubes?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I'll get on the pie, anyone want anything else?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"I did indeed acquire dope ass squares."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"This time I will pay my tour."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"I'll buy, but I'm trying to watch my diet."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She transfers meseta.*

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"Or you could go overachiever."

**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"I need to keep up the calories anyways."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Oh! Okay, I was thinkin' that this was on the house for a job well done~"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"I don't like the weight gain I've had since I graduated."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"A little extra fluff will only protect you from bullets~"

**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Relax, toots. Your bod's rockin', alright?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"With they way you're moving about, the amount you're eating is neglible."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*Not quite understanding the conversation, Limona just listens in.*

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"I'm actually primarily a ranged fighter. And I don't have my own photon reserves so most of my movement is because--" *She stops and slams her fist against the jetpack on her lower back.*

**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"Your body's still expendin' energy dealin' with the g-force o' your rapid movement. Also the lack o' photons-
**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	--means you're relyin' more on your biology. When I started changin' back to photon-based styles, my mass started to -
**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	--shrink."
**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	"I wouldn't be too worried. Let loose a lil', eh?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"I do. I call those cheat days."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Why not make everyday cheat day~"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"Because I have to keep in shape? I don't have a photon reserve, so I need to trim a lot of fat."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Hm, I suppose."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I suppose that's a no to pie then."

**[Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md):**	*A hand is placed to his ear* "...Ah crap. Sorry folks, I gotta handle somethin'. I'll handle the cookin' when ya get back, Nora!" 

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"See ya at home Bustie~"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"See you later and thanks again for the party!"
 
 
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"You had customers meantime?" *She asks Nora.*

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Nope~" 
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"It's been rather empty for the past few days."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Yes, there are less ARKs around the place than before."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"They are probably deployed somewhere else."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"They might be trying to reach the other region, the ones across the bridge by Halpha Lake."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"But the shield is still active? How they will manage to pass?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"They might just be deployed there to do research."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"There are a few isolated Ryukers people have access to outside of the confines. Cygnus HQ is actually right outside the wall."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"That's interesting."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Oh I wasn't aware of that !"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Yeah me neither."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"I mean, it's a science base. We don't exactly advertise."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Well, I'd imagine it was more talked about. But, nevertheless, it's interesting."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Yes it's just an important fact."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"That said, Cygnus has an agreement not to leave the reassembled ship shelter."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"A reassembled ship?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I see, I wonder if I could ever go."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"It would be nice to !"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"We open up to the general public every few months."
**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"But usually we limit it to the VR suite so the residents and techs aren't disturbed."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"How may I know when it happen?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"How's it with safety, are there often attacks like there is with the mining rigs?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"Short version, yes. But we have about ten Defenders and twenty JDs that protect the hangar entrance, or what we-
**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	refer to as 'Terminal Egress.'"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Interesting name."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She nods* "That's interesting !"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"I'm not sure of the specifics, because the ship has been buried since before I was born."
**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"But we have arcane technology and large constructs supporting the forces down there."
**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"We only really come up to assist operations in the Aelio region for now."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Intruiging."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"You don't happen to have any insight regarding the lack of memories from people?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"Nope. I'm Cygnus' 'First Born.'"
**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"As in the only one that was actually born here."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I mean I've met one school girl who was born here."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"What is her name?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	/ci2 2 "Yeah, but I doubt they're part of a small clannish technocratic cult."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Well, no. Her name is Rosie."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Oh, the Cast!"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Yeah~"
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"She was apparently casted shortly after her birth."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Quite unfortunate."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Yes sometime genetic or life luck isn't gentle."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"That's assuming CASTing is anything like the nightmarish hell Ben's internment is like it."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Apparently it's pretty universally horrible."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"I've never heard any real complaints from my colleagues."
**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"The idea of being a walking fortress is cool, though. Shame I don't have a reserve to power a CAST body."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"It can be traumatizing I imagine."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I was referring to the actual process of being casted."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"What is this process?"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"Thael said there isn't enough brain matter left over to remember the process. Or anything."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"It must be on a case to case basis then, from what I've heard."

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"Sounds like a sloppy integration. That's... unfortunate."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"The process of CASTing is when you convert a living being, like a deuman or newman into a CAST."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"I think everyone know it." *She answers with a certain distance.*

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	"I'm gonna... hit the uh... field."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Alright, have a good one Annie~"

**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):**	**[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md):** off-handedly puts down a meseta chip, swipes a bottle, and downs it as she departs.

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"See you later and good luck !"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	Nora slides the meseta chips left on the counter into her palm and carefully places it into the register. 

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"You working for how many hours?"

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Depends on the amount of customers, typically I just work how much is needed per day."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She nods, thinking about it.*

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I wonder if there'll be more customers today~"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"I wish, in waiting another emergency I have time to kill."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"And I admit a break from my project is welcome."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"How's that going by the way? The project, that is."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"I continue to work on all photonic wire."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"That's hard to compregend, how it work. So it take time."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Of course, it's very impressive."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	For example the photon technology absorb and send a certain amont of photon, it's not something we can store
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	undefinitely."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"That is very, incomprehensible, for a lack of a better word."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Yes I am on it since many month and still don't understand all."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Well, breakthroughs take time."

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"If not my mining operation start in two days, with Nidus as mercenary who protect miners."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Who's Nidus?"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Nidus is a man with clothes and gun, he is a mercenary."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	*Nora notices the orange-haired lady*: "Hello there madam, would you like to order anything?~"

**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Hello there!" 

[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Hey Lim. Hey... you."

**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I have a name~"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"You eyes looks differents?"

[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Can I get a uh..." She brings up a menu. "I can't even read some of these."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Would you like a drink or a desert?"~
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"I have still my tour up."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"There's coffee, tea, and a plethora of pies~"
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"We have most things~"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Bruh, that's gonna go straight to my thighs."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Don't see how that's an issue~"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"I look weird with big thighs. Trust me."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She still seems distant with the subject so just listen, curious.*
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Also I get stuck in vents as it is, so I really don't wanna risk it."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Alright. Perhaps a coffee then?"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"I'll just have a uh... the hell's a Midnight Blend? Whatever, I'll take one."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"What did you do in vents?"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Service the fans?"
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"That's a good choice, I'll get on that shortly, do take a seat if you please."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Also, it's faster to take the vents to the reactor room than it is to walk. I got short legs."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"We get some weird alien that tried to sabotage our reactors or life support and I'll be on him like black on tar."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Reactor room?"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"That was DOLLS or something else?"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Just some sort of weird hypothetical alien shapeshifter."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"You've not mentioned where you're stationed~"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Rebuilt hab from a shipwreck."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Oh! You're with Cygnus?"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Unless I was fired again."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"...again?"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Fired?"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*Almost at the same time as Nora*
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"My dearest darlingest brother has a tendency to overreact and fire the one person who memorized the layout."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Dear, oh dear. Family drama?"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Incidentally that makes me the one person who can maintain the shelter, since I can navigate the entire wreck."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Nah. He's just got a short fuse in general."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"But to be fair, HQ's kind of nuts. We had tribals in hydroponics until recently."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"What's a tribal?"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"These alien again?" *Tries to follow.*
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Like. Early societal age sapients."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I see."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Now they're armed and productive and happy. And we have hydroponics back."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"That's many things in a short row !"
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"It's strange, I've met two other Cygnus-members just today. Is it some field-day?"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"We talk with *[Benedict](Characters/Benedict%20Varden.md)*, *[Anora](Characters/Anora%20Casan.md)* and you so we get lot of information about Cygnus."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"This is my dedicated rampage end day, so..."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"...rampage end day?"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"I go onto the field for a period of thirty one days. Then get tired, come back and fix my gear."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Then I rest for one day, and then go out and do it again."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Interesting."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I just typically rest upwards of twenty hours a day~"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"That explain why we not see lot of people for while."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"I just have a set schedule. I've been getting recalled a lot lately to address the lack of manpower."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Because the Director would prefer to simply throw me at a problem rather than enlist thirty lesser troops."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"I see. I'll get on that coffee now and stop harrassing you with questions~"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"They do that often."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"What, throw me at a problem?"
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	*Nora went behind the back and started blending the midnight blend into a fine powder. She poured the powder into the--
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	brewer and waited for a while before finally pouring it up into a warm cup.*
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"Prefer to not hide more people."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	*She places the cup onto the counter and says:* "Here you are... I don't think I recall your name, madam."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	"To hire."
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"His official stance is 'I'd rather throw something indefatigueable and indestructable at it and hire a team to-
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	clean up your fuckin' mess than throw some rookies and have you follow after them to kill whatever's left over and-
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	retrieve their bodies.'" She says, in a very impressive imitation of Ben's voice.
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"One containment battle, One [Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)." She eyes Nora. "Cheers."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Your name's Containment Battle? Strange name."
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She winces*
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	She facepalms, hard. That's gonna swell later.
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"What?"
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	Nora says, continually oblivious.
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Sure. Fuck it, that can be another one of the pseudonyms I go by."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Wait, it's not your name?"
**[Limonaverse](Characters/Limonaverse.md):**	*She mutes herself, even if she looks like she know.*
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Sister, I don't use my name. Four people know it by happenstance."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Interesting."
**[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md):** 	"Why's that?"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"Because this world didn't need her. This world needs a [Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)."

Yazad	"May I ask what is it that the good madam does?"
[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md) looks at the double saber floating behind her. Then the armor. Then taps her mask.

[Custodian](Characters/Custodian.md)	"My actual function within the organization is an exterminator and executioner. When necessary, I seize the-
