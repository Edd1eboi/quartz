#### **[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):** goes into Sugar Kitty and stands by the bar whereupon she's greeted.

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Hello, and welcome to Sugar Kitty~"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Eurh... hi..."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Make yourself comfortable, madam. I do not recall seeing you here before~"
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Eh...?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"...new..."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"...new... here..."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Oh, I see. We have all been there at one point, fret not~"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Mm... uh... tea..."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Certainly, give me a moment~"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"...thanks..." she whispered audibly enough.

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	*[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) comes back with a fragrant cup of tea on a tray. Next to it sat a plate with three mini tarts.*
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"There you go, new madam~ Welcome to Central City. May I have your name?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"...thank... you..." She looked down, avoiding eye contact: "Eurh.... **[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	*[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md): takes a step back to give the seemingly shy girl her space* "Madam *[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):*, a pleasure to meet you~"

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"I am *[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):*."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"...no..." She attempted to joke: "...you're, uhhh.... short. Not **[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	*It took a moment for *[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md)* to process the supposed jest. When realization set in, he chuckles lightly*
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Well, you are not wrong. Although I can still be both, right~?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"...that is true I suppose..." She smiled, still avoiding eye-contact.

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	***[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):** reaches out to give the girl's head a little pat* "There, there. I know that being somewhere completely new and foreign is a cause for worry, but you are safe here~"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I... am glad."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"The people of Central City are lovely enough, you will be making friendships in no time~"

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"I wish you could have met Nora, she would bring you some joy for certain. Come to think of it, where is she?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I made... one friend... easy to talk to..."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Oh? Who is that friend, if you do not mind me asking~?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Miss Lumina..."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Oh, bless her sweet heart~ Madam Lumina is such a kind and sensble woman."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"She has a good aura."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"This is such an interesting discription."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Her photon field has a nice color..."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Goodness, you can see that?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Essentially."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Now I am curious, what kind of aura would you say that I have?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Hm..."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"It's not as visible as Miss Lumina's."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"How intriguing~"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**'s head tilted as she examined **[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**'s figure: "I'd say a cloudy, pink-ish color?"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Those red field waves above us are similar to it, though a different color."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	***[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):** smoothes his hand over his body and giggles* "I shall take your word for it, since I lack the gift to see it~"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Hm hm."

**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"I shall let you enjoy your tea now, duty calls so I must depart momentarily."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	She grabbed the cup from the table and took a sip: "Thank you for the tea."

#### *Atop the central city tower, a lone Hi-cast was curiously listening in on the two's conversation below*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Mm... good tea..."
D.Va	/la crouch
Lumi	/la sit1 
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Alright, I have to finish this mining rig defense mission and then come back and figure out dinner" ***[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):** mutters*

Lumi	/la sit2 
Lumi	/la sit3 
Paimon	/la sivapose2 
Lumi	/la sit7 
Lumi	/la sit8 
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Maybe I'll try to.. oh wait.. one of them left.." *she thought*
Lumi	/la sit8 
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	***[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):** continued sipping on her cup and occasionally took a bite out of the tarts.*
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Oh well, I'll converse with the one remaining.. or try to at least.." *She whispered*
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	/cla sideflip 
Reagen	*wakes from his moment of solace*  Oh. Tis a urgent task? I suppose I'll do that.
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	/vo13 /la bow s1.8
Reagen	Hm? Greetings miss. Alas Im abotu to join a mission. Though shall return in short order.
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"greetings sir" *the hi-cast curtiously curtsied
Reagen	/la greet 
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Best of luck then." 
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Please do come back with the least of injuries"
Reagen	Will be happy to asset engagement with ye then. And thank ye for thou sentiment. But tis nay I that relies on luck I assure.
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	***[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**, who'd not noticed the tiny figure approaching, glanced at them and took a bite out of her first tart.*
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"..Hello madam..."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Greetings miss. A pleasure to meet you."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	/vo13 /la bow s1.8
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Is this a place of refreshments?"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Likewise... want a tart?" she lifted a tart from the plate.
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Yes."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Please. I'm famished, and I not know why."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	/cla crosslegs 
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Have you eaten?"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	/la crosslegs 
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"..not since I've woken here. I'm afraid"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I see. I came here today, you?"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"I've stumbled upon this settlement after a good bit of wandering"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	/cla sit1
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Funny that, I remember not where I came from but know who I was.. or maybe was.. The memory is fuzzy.."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"That is the case with most people around here."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"A common occurence? strange that."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	*She picked up a small desert fork and began munching on the tart infront of her*
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Truly. I suspect it has something to do with the photon fields on this planet. They look completely off." 
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Again, many thanks for the food." *she said with a full mouth* I've not eaten in days
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Of course, you can order more food at the counter if you wish."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"..why do us hi-casts even need to eat, I wonder? to design such a non essential liability.."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"It is rather nice to taste and eat. Perhaps it's a kindness from the developers?"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"I'll thank my creators for our tastebuds though, tarts are delicious.."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"That they are."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Ah, excuse my rudeness. I haven't properly introduced myself"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Hm?" She tilted her head slightly.
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	" I am Hi-cast Model Type: Yggdrasil, Onsite Kill, artificial intelligence. Codename, **[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**." 
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Mm, **[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**, that's a nice name..."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"My name's **[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**."
gomas	/la yell
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"A pleasure to make your acquaintance **[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**." *She smiled*
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"As is yours." she looked at **[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):** and noted that her photon field was barely visible: "Hm... interesting."
SYXG98	nice to see roleplayers in the wild
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	*The cast noticed **[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):** eyeing her frame* "Is anything the matter? Is my shell chipped?"
Eddie_	b26 is the normal block for alot of rpers :>
Syx	/la sit1 
SYXG98	Oooh I didn't know
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Mm, no. It's just that you haven't got a very strong aura."
Eddie_	:)
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Ah.. you can see photons?" *She asked curiously* "Intruiging. Hm.. I guess the reasoning would probably be my...
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Ah, Madam **[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**, I see that you already made a new friend~"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	Previous life's profession.. if one would call such barbaric acts a profession.."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Mm, yes, **[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):** friend."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Barbaric acts?"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	*The hi cast displayed a curtious nod* "Greeting ma'am"
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Greetings, Madam **[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**. And welcome to Sugar Kitty~ What is this about barbaric acts?"
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	/la deepbow 
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Let's leave the past in the past.. Memories are fuzzy, but still, not in the least unpleasant.."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I see."
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Greetings~"
SYXG98	is there a common canon or everyone just playing to the spirit of the gameworld?
Eddie_	basically just follow the set lore from the game and it's probably fine
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"As I've said to miss **[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**, my name is Model type: Yggdrasil, onsite Kill Artificial intelligence. Do with that information
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	as you will.."
Syx	*speaks in a distinctly high voice* "Hello!"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Does that mean you're not a carbon-based creature?"
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Awh, look at you~ Welcome to Sugar Kitty. What is your name?"
Syx	*with an emphatic gesture the cast annouces* "I'm Kobun!!"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Im a Hi-cast. A robotic sentient automata, built for specific tasks and duties. Apparently, I was a tad..
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	Defective, or as my creators noted. model number 00001-A, a prototype."
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Sir Kobun, then? How adorably quaint~ "
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"The first model would surely have a few bugs" *She chuckled*
Syx	/la salute 
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"That would explain why you're not outputting a very strong photon field."
Reagen	Forgive my parting in such haste. But I have returned. 
Reagen	/la greet 
Syx	*wiggles in place for a few moments* "Who are you!!"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"..yes, lets leave it at that." *she warily smiled*
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I must ask though, what were you made for?"
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"I am **[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**, a waiter in this establishment~ WHat may I serve you today?"
Syx	*answers like he is on a trivia show* "Meat!!"
Syx	/la yes 
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"A lady must have some secrets worth keeping" *She teased* "And of you? I know not where you came?"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Space."
Reagen	/la sit1 
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	***[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):** chuckles behind his sleeve* "A more common order than you think in a cafe, so I shall get you that in a moment~"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"That's a broad place to come from.."
Reagen	*Not wishing to disturb thier conversation, he returns to his seat he was earlier since he had not gotten reply*
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	/cla bbq 
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"That is the predicament, I have no clue where I'm from."
Syx	*impaitently taps his hands on the counter*
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	***[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):** notices the large form and waves* "Good day, Sir Reagen~ It has been a while."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Oh apologies Sir, I've been quite rude to not give a reply. How was the hunt?"
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	*With deft hands, **[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):** produces a platter from below the counter and stacks the grilled skewers neatly on it*
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Meat for Sir Kobun, as ordered~"
Reagen	Hm? *took him a moment to recognize was talking to him, he looks over his shoulder*  OH twas fair enough. 
Syx	/toge "Arigato gozaimasu!!"
Syx	/la darkblast4 
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	***[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):** flinches slightly at the sudden exclamation, but then he smiles. It looks like Kobun was happy*
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	Were great trophies ascertained? I've not known the beasts of this land quite yet."
Syx	*somehow, despite not having a mouth, the food neatly phases through his face as if it was teleporting*
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	*Speaking to *[Clara](Characters/Clara.md)* "That is quite a predicament.. but maybe its for the best? A new life with no strings attached"
Reagen	Twas.. I suppose fairly decent, nothing to cry home about tis sort to say.  Twas better than the usual I suffice.
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"This is a rather...interesting method of eating. Would you mind me asking what you are, Sir Kobun~?"
Syx	"OoOOoOOooooh~!!" 
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	Responding to **[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**: "A new life with no strings attached is only for the best when you know what you lose."
Syx	*tilts his head* "Is it not obvious???"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	*Leaning back in her chair* "I think I know what I'm losing, and if none of that followed me here, I'd be all the happier"
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"After some time in Central City, it is rather difficult to make assumptions about the origins of people~"
Syx	*does a dainty twirl, showing off his physique* "I'm a dragon!"
Syx	/la laugh 
Syx	/la sexy 
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"True, but that's anecdotal."
Syx	/la proudleg 
Syx	/la foldarms 
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"A dragon, you say? Goodness gracious, and an adorable one as well. Truly, Central City is a place for all sorts of
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	People."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"So it is. Anywho. I still know not of this land. What is.. all of this?"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I'm not quite sure."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I only came here today."
Syx	*makes pleasant sounding squeal* "Aayeeee~~!!" 
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"It seems, pleasant enough.."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"That it is."
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	***[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):** reaches over to attempt a pet on Kobun's head*
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"By the way, compliments to the chef, the tart was divine"
Syx	*acknowledges with a distinct sounding robotic huff, bowing his head for them to reach* "Aaaa~"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I agree. The chef is the short man over there." She said and pointed to **[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**.
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	*Happily, **[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):** goes about petting and stroking Kobun's head gently, careful not to get too eager*
Syx	*delighted robotic squeals echo about, his robotic wings stretch out and flap excitedly*
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	*A short pause* "Might I ask.. what do you plan on doing now? with no memories on a strange world."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"It seems you have abilities that might be of use to the local militia, if they exist in formality"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Militia... oh! The ARKs defenders? I've enrolled there as a fighter."
**[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md):**	"Oh, goodness gracious. The weekly grocery sale is about to take place. I shall excuse myself for now~"
Syx	"Bye *[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md)*!!!"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"..I'm sorry could you repeat that? the 'what' defenders?" *she repeated, slightly concerned*
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"ARKs."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"..." *A pause then a sigh* "drat."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Drat?"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Nothing nothing~" *She forced a smile*
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"That doesn't look like nothing. I can visibly see a photon field being generated around your mouth."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Don't drain your batteries."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"I don't use batteries" *She said relaxing a bit* "I run off of the ambient photons in the air"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I see."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Don't know how.. ask my creator.." *She chuckled*
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	*She made a hand waving motion sarcastically* "Photons"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Photons."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"And here I thought I'd landed somewhere they weren't.." ***[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):** muttered*
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*Having her uniquely-shaped ears, **[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):** heard most of the words*: "What do you mean?"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"You really are a sharp one, with those senses.." "You'd be an excellent arks operative.."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I sense that's not in your interests though."
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Once upon a time, great minds came together to fight an almost undefeatable foe."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"A foe?"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"They built ships of glass and soldiers of steel, built weapons and machinations unimaginable
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"and one day, 2 heroes came and saved everyone from disaster"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"How does this relate to the ARKs though?"
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"It was happily ever after, a true fairy tail story. but what of the war machines they left in their wake?"
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I do not know."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Well, anyway **[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**, it was nice meeting you, however I must get my rest so I can fight on tomorrow."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She bowed and went off.*
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"..Some were abandoned, some never stopped fighting.." *she sighed* 
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"Later then." *she smiled*
**[Yokai](Characters/Yokai.md):**	"I mid you adieu" 
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Yes." She responded with a smile.
