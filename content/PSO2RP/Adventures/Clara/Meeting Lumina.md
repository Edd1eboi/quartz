#### Clara walks up to a pleasant looking lady who seems to be in thought.

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):** "Hey there..."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You need something?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I- uh... I don't know."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You don't know. *Hmmph*. You're not 'new' are you?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Uhm, define new?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Nevermind." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said,* "Hello to you too."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She bowed lightly:* "Good to meet you, miss...?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"*[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)*. Science division."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"*[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)*?~ That's a nice name."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Hmm... Yours?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"My name's *[Clara](Characters/Clara.md)*, ms. *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)*."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"*[Clara](Characters/Clara.md)*, that too is a nice name." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said, pulling up her console.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Oh? Thank you." *She noticed the console and proceeded to ask:* "What are you doing there?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She walked up behind [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) and peered over her shoulder:* "Hm."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Nothing really." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said,* "Just looking over relevant data."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*It was data from the last urgent quest. She was compiling numbers.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Right, you were with the science division." She look confused at the data: "What are you analyzing?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Combat records, so we can keep track of the opposition's numbers."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It allows us to prepare ourselves next time."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I see. Anything conclusive?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"We're seeing more Pettax grade DOLLS going after the mining rigs."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It's been steadily growing, the average that is."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"What about the median?" *She responded slightly teasingly.*

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You'll see it all in a viewscreen somewhere."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Hm, okay." *Suddenly her stomach audibly growled and nervously she said:* "You don't happen to know where I could get a meal?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... How long have you lived in this city?" *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) asked [Clara](Characters/Clara.md).*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Uh, well, I got here today."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"So you ARE new. Are you registered with ARKS?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Yeah! I fought some terrifying three-headed monster."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You're new and you went against a Nex? Not TOO bad. Come on." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md): said, dismissing her console and walking.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Oh! Okay."

#### The two walked over to the café.  

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"This is the café. You can get something to eat here."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Ah I see, would you perhaps like to join me for a meal? First day and all." *She anxiously leered over at the bar-disk.*

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... ... I suppose so." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said, walking under the disk-like roof with a sigh.*

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) looked to [Clara](Characters/Clara.md)*. "What do you want?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Some sort of food." *She responded anxiously, at a loss of words.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*[Clara](Characters/Clara.md) stood behind [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):, almost hiding from the bar-maid's glare:* "Could you, uh.. possibly order for me?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She ran off to hide behind a tree:* "You've, uh.. got this...!"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"What the Hell are..." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) frowned at the woman, and scoffed.* "Two shrimp spring roll plates and two teas."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*The bar-maid responds*: "Of course, take a seat over there."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Thanks." *she moved to sit.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*[Clara](Characters/Clara.md): carefully moved to the table where [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md): was sat.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"T..- thanks... for ordering..."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Sit here"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"O- okay."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	She took a seat, gracefully.

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... What got into you? Why the sudden shyness?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Uh, ergh... well, I just get really like, scared almost, talking to people."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... You talked to me just fine earlier."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"W- well, you looked nice to talk to, you get what I mean?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... You felt comfortable around me due to my appearance?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Sort of, more-so your... aura? I don't know how to explain it."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Aura. Interesting." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said,* "Perhaps it's my photon affinity."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Photon affinity?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Or rather, photon aptitude. Having a high photon aptitude means that I am able to control photons far better than others."
**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Those with a high photon aptitude can also have this... aura surrounding them."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I assume there's some sort of 'but' coming after that."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It CAN be dangerous. If I have a higher photon aptitude, but my body is unable to withstand the stress it brings..."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It can be bad."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Guess you've gotta be able to control 'em photons real good, eh...?" She joked, attempting to raise the mood.

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"I do. My body must be treated like a temple if I am to keep my own photons from burning me from the inside."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I want to say that's rather dark, though I'd be lying as photons are rather bright."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*Pretty soon, their food would come. Each woman got two shrimp spring rolls with lines of peanut sauce drizzled over them.*
**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*They also each got iced tea, sweetened carefully as to not be too overwhelming.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She awed at the food and drinks that were infront of the two.*

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*They could see there were three shrimps on top of the spring rolls, just under the clear wrapping. [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) took one and bit into it. There was a satisfying crunch to it from the vegetables.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*[Clara](Characters/Clara.md) looked as [Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) ate the roll and brought forth her shaking hand to grab a roll aswell.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	She took a bite and her eyes lit up: "This..."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"This is amazing."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It's good. Don't worry." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said. The newman may not realize it, but her voice was also very calming.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Mm-hm!" *She responded now, having a mouth full of spring rolls.*

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):** shook her head and enjoyed her's as a respectable pace.

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"STh-is-... ishch... so... gswawhood..." *She said and quickly realizing that her mouth was full. She embarrassingly looked down at her plate to avoid eye contact.*

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Aelio seafood can't be beat." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said, finishing one of her rolls.* 

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Mhm, though I don't know if that's my hunger speaking. Haven't had food all day."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You can't go without eating." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)* said. "Eat until you're full."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"It's been an eventful day, to say the least. Thank you for the food~" 

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):** responded, taking another bite and a sip-

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	of the iced tea.

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"No problem." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md) said, getting to her second spring roll. They were rather big, able to fill up small bellies.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"If you don't mind me asking, how'd you end up in this place? I assume through the 'big-space-pod-thing'?

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"... ... Yeah."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"...how long have you been here?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"More than a decade. I came here as a child."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Oh man."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Is coming as a child common here?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It isn't."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Must've been lonely."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It was." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)* said, "But I had people to look after me."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	She finished her springrolls, and sipped her tea. That hit the spot.

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"That's good atleast." She stated, "How come I can't remember anything from.. before the crash...?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"That is a question we all ask ourselves. We don't remember. Most of us don't. But we intend to find out why."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"That's something thankfully."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"If nobody can remember anything it's most likely not a crash-related head injury."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Must be something with this place - I noticed the almost constructed way everything is."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"That is true. We find this place strange, even if it's all we ever knew. It implies that we remember someplace different.."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Yeah. I've had a little time to think about the reasons why I was here while walking between checkpoints and--

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	have reasoned that it's mostly likely some kind of field, perhaps a photon field, that alters the memory of people."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Not sure what kind of civilization that would be in possesion of that kind of technology, but they must be powerful."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"It's a solid theory. This place DOES seem to be made for us. The training cocoons, the towers, the abundant food."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"But then you have the DOLLs. Our enemies."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Any idea what they are?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Eternal enemies, training robots, we're not sure. At the moment all we can do is beat them in an arms race."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"How are we supposed to beat an enemy that we don't know?"


**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"We learn."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I see."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I wonder why the civilization before us decided to create a mind-altering field."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"We won't know for some time."
**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Are you full?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Yeah! This was great, thank you very much."
**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	*She ate the last roll out of gluttony.*

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Good. Get used to the people here. You won't last if you can't handle speaking to them."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Erhh... could you maybe, by chance, help me with that?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"I suppose if I must."
**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	*She picked herself up and put a hand to her stomach. She could appreciate a full tummy, the way it felt.*

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"You don't have to if you don't want to!" *She reassured, weakly.*

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Then again, it is one of my duties as a ground operator."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Oh- alright!"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You're rather tall, by the way."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"As are you~"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Well, if I was shorter, I may have a harder time managing my power."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Maybe it'd scale proportionally?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"You mean I'll grow bigger?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Oh no, I meant that you'd have less power if you were shorter."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Ah, well probably not. I know a short girl who's power rivals mine. She has to run and exercise everyday to keep it under control."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Oh really?"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Yeah. She is wired." *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)* said, "What about you? Can you feel the energy around you?"

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"I can't really feel it, it's more like it's a pleasant looking energy around certain things or people, like yourself."

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Alright, well, we'll see how you fair in time. I need to get back to work. If I see you, I'll help you more."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Thank you very much Miss *[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md)*~"

**[Lumina](Characters/Lumina.md):**	"Sure thing, *[Clara](Characters/Clara.md)*."

**[Clara](Characters/Clara.md):**	"Good luck with your analyzing."

#### Clara remained at the café whilst Lumina went off to do her business.
