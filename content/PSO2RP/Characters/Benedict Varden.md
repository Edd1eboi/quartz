<h4 align="center">Background:</h4>

Ben is an odd one. First appearances suggest he's far more dignified than he is. In truth he's actually a somewhat crass, sardonic man capable of a great empathy. 
Stumbling from a pod with an ancient weapon, he dragged himself through ALTERS and DOLLS alike with a bloody-minded determination to save others like him. He salvaged a copy of what he claims is the ARKS Charter and rejoined his allies, but founded Project Cygnus in line with the charter in order to act as an expeditionary effort rather than the rapid response team. 

While critical of new Defenders, he acknowledges they are fit for purpose in their new role saying "*They aren't bad. It just isn't in line with the Charter.*" 

He seems to hold a very high opinion of them, regardless, and fulfills his nominal duties to the organization where and when he can, with Cygnus being less a defiance of the Aelio Chapter and more a polity of more scientifically curious ARKS that are better suited to exploration. Despite this openness with regards to the Aelio ARKS, he's still rather secretive and a consummate deceiver, twisting the truth to preserve the integrity of his agendas, whatever they may be.
