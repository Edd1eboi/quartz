<h4 align="center">Background:</h4>

It never bothered [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) much that his earliest memories of life are a haze. What he can remember clearly is waking up one day to the face of an older girl who turned out to be his sister. Questions regarding several things did occasionally pass through his mind, but the daily grind of trying to survive and earning a living rendered such thoughts unimportant. 

For years, he lived a humble yet happy life with his sister, working two jobs and saving up for their shared dream of one day owning [Sugar Kitty](Places/Sugar%20Kitty.md), the café they work at. On a day that seemed just like any other, his sister simply would not wake up-- and that was the day when [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) found out that his ‘[sister](Characters/Suyin.md)’ is a semi-organic cyborg whose outdated hardware had just failed. 

The revelation, though surprising, did very little to change the pair’s familial bond, and [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) was quick to use all of his savings to offer the girl a shiny new upgrade. These days, [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) is hard at work to rebuild his account, so he can afford all the cute outfits and weapons he wants. *Really, have you seen these market prices?*
