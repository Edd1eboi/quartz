#### Nora approaches the café and notices the odd sized pair.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Ah, my name is *[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md)*, by the way~"

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"And you?"

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):** "I'm known as the Flame Swordsman by 
some. The actual name, *[XushinPhoenix](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md).*"

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	*Goes on to follow.*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Oh, goodness. That is a rather-- strong name. Do you happen to really wield a sword of fire?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Yeah, *heh*, something like that.  *He says with a smirk.*

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**  *waved 
at him.*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Hello *[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md)*!

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Hiya!~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	*Is clearly curious, but he says nothing regarding the flaming sword* 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	'Sup there tootz. *he says nodding too.*

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	*Nods back.*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Come, you can rest here~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	*Pulls out a picnic blanket by the tree next to the café and sits.*

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Yeah I guess this isn't a bad spot either.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	It is rather peaceful, and far from traffic. Mister Flame.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	*Crouches down and leans up against the 
tree, crossing his arms*

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Ah well,  dont see many folks walking on 
the grassy parts anyway. But at least if I have need for a stiff drink

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	dont got to go very far. heh.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Sleep well~ Should you ever fancy a LIGHT drink, do visit us~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Hot cocoa is my specialty~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Do you like hot cocoa?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Ah nah Im not that big on hot cocoa, well unless 
it gets cold of course.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	didnt know ya worked here though.  First time 
seein' someone like ya.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	I drink here all the time. Usually order me wine 
coolers or something.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	I would like to think that I am a decent 
baker~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	heh. I can kinda tell just lookin' at ya.  Can 
always use the dispensers. 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Ah bakin' huh? that aint bad.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Aint shy when it comes to pie.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Hehe, this seems like a rather funny slogan 
to use for a bakery. I have had the most amusing patron yesterday.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	And now you. 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Heh. Amusing heh? Not suprised about that. I 
am pretty amusing. *he says with a wide grin and nod of approval*


**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	*Giggles lightly* That you are, Sir Flame. A 
different brand of amusing, I would say. 

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Ah, goodness me, am I keep you up?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Hey even better.  Nah tootz. I been napping for 
a good while already. If ya managed to wake me up.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Only meant was going to wake soon myself 
anyway.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	*He says with a lazy shrug.*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	I must ask, if I may, what is a 'tootz'?


**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	A tootz? It's you. -*He says and points to [Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md)*-  And even that girl over there looking like she stuck in between some chairs.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	*points to Suyin*

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	*Waves*

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	*Waves back.*  Yo tootz. 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):** *He turns back towards with a smirk.* Yeah, see.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Oh, that is my sister. Not the first one, but the second~ I may be less of a tootz than them both, I am afraid.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Oh. Well I thought something looked similar. 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	ya do seem to look alike.


**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Awh, did you hear that, Suyin? He said we looked alike~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Its a bar. So can take that as it is. Whatever ya do in it, is up to you. 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	As long as dont get ya in trouble of course. 

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	It is a cafe, as far as I am concerned~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	cafe, though all I mostly order is drinks.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	What is your favorite?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Oh its a particularly strong wine cooler called 
Starbreeze Coolers.  Though Im still scoutin' out for different kinds.


**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	I stay away from the really hard stuff, that taste 
like cleaner, or that light stuff that taste like watered down cold piss

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	that people call beer.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	That so called piss is the best!!~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	hey whatever floats your boat tootz

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	I...ahaha, I would not know about any of that 
if I am to be frank.


**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	more for you. *he laughs*

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	*Pouts.*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	I do love cocktails though. Especially summer fruits~ *Giggles and lightly claps his hands once*

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Hey its fine. different strokes for different folks. 
*he says with a casual shrug*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Oranges, peaches, and pineapples~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Oh do like a good cocktail if it has a kick.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Do you mind if I take a s.. hmm, a sit?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Hey go right ahead.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Thank you~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Theres enough grass for all the butts to sit on.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Hehe~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	*Despite his efforts to contain it, **[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**'s giggle still escaped him*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	You really are an amusing man, Sir Flame.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	That he is!

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	What can I say? heh, it is what it is. *he says 
with another shrug, laughing*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Large in body and in personality, how fitting~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Oh lets not get to talking about what I have 
being large.  Dont want to sully the ears of any innocents. Heh.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	*Ahh!*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Your weapon? I can see it sticking behind 
your back.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	*Looks over himself with some surprise, looking 
down, then to his back.*  Oh! that one.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Heh. Yeah that counts. 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	It's sort of heirloom, I've always had it, even 
when I woke up here.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Oh, so it is a family item? How sweet it must 
be to have something from your family.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Do you have memories of your life previous to that 
of waking up here?

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	If you don't mind me intruding that is!!~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	I might. I might not. I dont worry about it. Never 
was one to really worry about the before. 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	more so the current and after.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	I have this with me, its all I need in regards to 
whatever was back then.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	You and me both, Sir Flame. Life is what you 
make it to be.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	*knocks a finger at his scabard on his back* 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Yep, see you catchin' what I'm throwin'

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Wherefore do you think that? I personally think that 
the past is an intrigue!

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	*[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md)* does make a valid point as well. I do like listening to people tell me their stories.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	yeah for some.  Me. eh. I make my own intruige 
or go and find it.  I'm a wanderer, kinda always have been.

#### Ceyella approaches the group.
**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Oh its tech support girl.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Oh, greetings~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Welcome, madam. Would you care to join us 
for chicken mayo sandwiches and a story about Kvasir?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	I mentioned ya earlier

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Aye yes, that he did!

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	About there being a girl that runs around here alot.

*Ceyella*:	I don't consume nutrients, sorry, bye!

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Awh.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	And behold, there she goes

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Dont feel bad, she does that like.. all the time.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Worrying...

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	just goes nd runs off.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	We shall meet again, I hope~

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Or not, might be a synth!

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Yeah probably, don't take it personally. 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	From what I'm told, she's a Hi-Cast.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	What is that?

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	A Hi-what?

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	I've heard of Hi-Fi, but never Hi-...cast?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	You know how regular casts are still partly 
organic to some degree right?

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Mm... I think so yes.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Ah...

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Well Hi-casts are completely synthetic. AI and everything


### *The alert for mining rigs being under attack goes off in the city.*

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Duty calls.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Duty is scary~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Ah we got some time.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	its in preparation phase.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	This is why it is my job to do it, *[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md)*~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Being the man of the cafe and all.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	been waitin' for it myself.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	But what about the cafe? Whatever will we do without you! 

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	theres always to self serve panels. heh

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Panels?

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Ah, our manager, Mr. Hammy the hamster, does a good job handling it.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	..A hamster?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	yeah the panels ya see on the counters.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Oh I see!

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Indeed, my sister's hamster.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Interesting...

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Or she is his pet, I cannot even tell.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	But yeah HI-Casts arebasically AI with a synthetic body

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	I shall take note of this. Thank you, Sir Flame!

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	That is intriguing indeed.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Will you join us *[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md)*? Or will you stay here?

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	I might decide to join you~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Do give me a moment~

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Of course!

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Yeah its almsot time anyway.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	*stands and stretches*

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Turn around!

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	I've gotta change!!

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Hm... I'll turn around, though dont think it'll do much good. Heh.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	There we are~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Since this new operation. Think we should coordinate.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Look good in that.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	I am set as well~

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Thank you, as do you!

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Well, in your outfit of course, not mine~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Coordinate we should.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	We should pick a tower and stick to it. Only have one person go off and intercept if need be.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	since theres 3 towers.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	the rest of the folks should divide up to at least 2 each for the rest.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	cause heard things get rough.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	I suppose since I'm a ranger I'll be trying to keep myself close to the towers and shoot homing missiles on repeat!

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	You got it.

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	That they do. I shall look after a tower as well.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Lets focus on our own tower.  Stay together.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Yessir!

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	that way if the others fuck up, we still holding ours down.
 
**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	I am sort of confused as to how the point system functions? Can I suppose that you have any idea?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Well the points are shared from the things you collect goes into a pool from everyone

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Take the downtime between waves to collect them.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	*nods* yep

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Oh I see! That sounds trivial then.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	yeah. You use the points if things look hairy

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	such as the tower gets damaged

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Do let me know when you are ready to depart.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	or you see a large squadron coming thats more than you think you can deal with at once

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	should be a panel at the towers to activate

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	I see I see!

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	I am ready to go!~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Alright we got our game plan.

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Im ready to roll too

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	We'll claim whatever tower is emptiest

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Good luck!

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Do not hesitate to call for help if needed~

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	Gonna head to purple

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Should I head with you?

**[Xushin](PSO2RP/Characters/XushinPhoenix.md):**	yep you know the plan

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Thanks guys~

##### Xushin accidentally hits Nora's head in an attempt to do a thumbs up, but does not see her.

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	Ow!
