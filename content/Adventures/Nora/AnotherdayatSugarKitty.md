#### *Nora saw Yazad approaching and waved.* Heya Jazzywazzy!

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	Hello, [Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md)~ You are looking rather radiant today~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	New hair?

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):** "I braided and combed my hair!

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"I noticed~ It really frames your face rather well~

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Why thank you~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"I took a nap day yesterday, sorry for not showing up to work~

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"My, you look as though you had grown even more, I am a proud father~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"That makes me happy."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Oh, worry not about it~ The fact that you can nap for an entire day amuses me, however."

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"A cat must get her beauty rest."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Well, I cannot disagree with that~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Anything happen while I was asleep?~"

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Well, there is always quite a bit going on. A shy but sweet girl visited yesterday, along with 
an adorable little dragon~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"A- a dragon?"

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"A mini dragon~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"That's concerning."

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"What if he set the cafe on fire?"

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Is it? I thought that he was cute. He was also very friendly. Now that I think about it, I do not 
know if he can even produce any fire."

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Glad he's nice atleast."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Most people in the city are, bless them. I cannot say that I have met anyone who is not 
nice."

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Yeah~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Doesn't seem to be much pressure this evening~"

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Sometimes it is nice to not be too busy."

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Yeah, but I'm bored."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"What do you often do to enjoy yourself besides napping?"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Usually I explore Aelio and try to take photos with my mag. It's not very easy though."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Ah, I see you taking photos sometimes. It is such a nice thing to do: keeping memories~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Yeah... I wish we could remember more things from our pasts."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"As do I...but...I try not to let it get me down, no matter how much I want to know."

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Mm... you think we'll ever remember these things?"

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"I have hope that we will, and I would rather hold on to that hope rather than despair~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"I agree. I do wonder how I got my cat-features sometimes."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	*[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md) chuckles and lightly pinches [Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md)'s cheek* "You clearly had adorable parents with 
good genes. Cheer up~" 

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	*[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md) smiled a little and flinched as she was pinched:* "Well I hope so."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"But until you manage to find them, you are my daughter~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"That'll have to be satisfactory in the meantime~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"But you must find a mother soon."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Why, thank you for accepting me as your parent, milady. And I can be both."

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Hm. We'll see about that last part~"

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"I am confident in my multi-parenting abilities~" 

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"I sure hope so~"

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Well, since the cafe is now in capable hands, I should go take care of some other matters."

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"You take care and stay good~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"You too Jazzy~"

**[Nora](PSO2RP/Characters/NoraHonora.md):**	"Make some good dinner~"

**[Yazad](PSO2RP/Characters/YazadAHeydar.md):**	"Always~"

#### *Nora waved as he left.*
