# Things to be done on the Discord/needs deciding on:
---

#### Regarding these things, I won't implement them until we have a clear idea of what we want and a solid baseline for the idea. 


---

### Community values:

> Status: WIP

- **This one is more for me to write up properly, but I'll put it here anyhow, since I do want others' opinions on this!**
	- *What values does this community have regarding role-play in PSO2NGS?*
		- Currently I'm thinking that this community will be mostly-lore abiding, meaning that the RP would mostly consist of interactions and events that could be explained within existing canon, and that the basis for personal canon shouldn't stem from outside of PSO2, but rather from the game's existing canon.
		- I think RP should be cooperative and I think that we should have a system in place for allowing for discussion in a constructive and helpful way. Thereby eliminating the problems of having some people go off on their own tangents and unpurposely *(or purposely)* excluding others since the goal is that everyone should be able to cooperate without feeling the "need" to have to break lore.
			- *Sub-point to this:* This isn't something that I think should be a black-and-white thing, as long as **everyone** gets along with the ideas that comes up, then anything goes. 

		- Civility is an important thing aswell, I do not think that we should discourage others from coming up with "crazy" ideas, but we need to relate to the lore, so it's a fine balance that we've all got to help reach.

### Lore Channel:

> Status: TBD

- **Channel for storing lore?**
	- *How should we store that?*
	- *How do we format the lore?*

---

### Which block?

> Status: TBD

- **What block should we use?**
	- *Current idea is to stay on B26.*

---

### Community name:

> Status: TBD

- **Name for the Discord?**
	- *Currently it's "The 26th ARKs Division"*.
	- ***Sub-issue:*** *Logo's dependent on the name, so for the moment it's not permanent, it'll change with how the community wants it to be.*

---

### Personal roles: 

> Status: Done! *(-ish)*

- #### Added personal roles - Some things will be changed further on, but for now it's okay.

### Wikihelp!

> Status: Still looking!

- **Making the wiki is fun and all, but I could use some help with proof-reading logs and formatting them properly - along with working on community-character sheets!**
	- *This would be completely voluntary and I'd personally help you :)*

---

### Social links (where?):

> Status: TBD

- **Screenshots channel and personal twitters?**
	- *Do we want to post twitter-links (or similar) in #character-screenshots or should we seperate the two into something like " #twitter-posts "?*

---

### NGS Leaks / Spoilers:

> Status: TBD

- **NGS Leaks/Spoilers channel?**
	- *I essentially think this can be added, it's just a matter of formatting - ergo it's on the todo-list.*
---
- **Anything else? Just drop them in #suggestions!**
