<h4 align="center">Background:</h4>

Limona isn't a Meteorn neither an Halphans. But a total foreign of the ARKS. At the origin, she is the advertisement mascot of an interplanetary corporation, specialized into the production and delivery of sodas.

Her V.I.P. convoy was recently attacked and hijacked by the DOLLS, forcing passengers to escape to the closest planet at board a pod. For some reason, Limona was separated from the rest of her staff.
