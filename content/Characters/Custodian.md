<h4 align="center">Background:</h4>

A relentless operative that has been awake and active for a few years now, bearing a mask she's become known for, as it's the only approximation of her face on any records. When she can be bothered to cooperate with other ARKS, she can best be described as a loyal and determined ally, although she tends to vanish as quickly as she arrives. Despite this, she's a reasonable comrade, able to cooperate for long enough periods and comport herself respectfully. It's clear that she has more compassion for the dead than the living, which is not to say she is dispassionate to her peers, it is more that she sees death as an inevitability and must thusly have her peers give it a merry chase first.

Because of her tendency to skirt the razor's edge and take deadly risks to keep her comrades alive, she's garnered a reputation as some sort of unkillable, taciturn revenant that fulfills her tasks with ruthless efficiency and then disappears. It's implied she's not even aware of her tendency to save lives, shrugging off thanks with a simple "Well, you were alive when I found you, so..." and trailing off, only to once again make her way to the next emergency, only giving pause to give the dead their due and offer parting words.

The truth is simple, and perhaps sadder. The Custodian is a deeply troubled woman haunted by delusions of ghostly figures she cannot recognize and is bothered even further by the fact that she was chosen. This leaves her unable to sleep and thus having to fight in order to placate these "ghosts." The lack of a sleep cycle leaves her irritable, and just self-aware enough that she shuts up and replies in a veneer of an even temper in order to avoid alienating her allies, and due to her superior fighting instincts is able to function even in her sleep deprived state, dozing off while 'dormant' with one eye open and keeping her distance so others don't realize that her delusions are throwing her into a downward spiral, which rises to the surface when pushed beyond what her rational mind can handle and she lashes out.

The Custodian typically ensures one day of true dormancy per thirty, resupplying and minimizing labour in order to recuperate in vain hopes that she can reclaim the vestiges of her humanity, though more often than not she is forced to act. This is often the times when her true self slips out, an educated citizen turned rampaging war engine due to her circumstance
