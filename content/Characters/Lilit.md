<h4 align="center">Background:</h4>

Lilit comes from the ancient fish kingdom known as Atlantis. She comes from a long line regents. Her father, The King of Atlantis, has been holding on to the throne to a long time. One day, Lilit's unbridled rage at her father's long reign eventually comes to a head when she decides to overthrow him. However, her attempt is unsuccessful and she must quickly flee the fish kingdom. In a shady, probably not legal, deal she acquired some legs and quickly began making her way to land. Above the sea she discovered a whole new world of weaponry and people, and made it her mission to learn from them and grow as powerful as she could. 

Above ground she met many sympathetic people, including her girlfriend [Gogo](Characters/Gogo.md) and her best friend [Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md). She also got acquainted with the genius [Gaia](Characters/Gaia%20Stellaria.md), her close friend [Equinox](Characters/Equinox.md) and the kind and caring [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md). [Lilit](Characters/Lilit.md) is a tall blue girl.
