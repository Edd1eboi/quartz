title: About Lumina
collapse: open

Lumina is one of the few Meteorn that were transported as a child. Her pod was found in the shallows of Halphia Lake. She awoke surrounded by water, and under a sparkling night sky and bright full moon. Having no name, she would be called 'Lumina' for the way her skin and hair seemed to stand out in the moonlight, characteristics similar to a fictional princess of the moon bearing the same name. At first, ARKS was unsure why a child would be a meteorn, but when they were ambushed by dolls while taking her to Central City, the girl instinctively grabbed a dropped rod from the ground and defended herself and the others with lightning. They had no other questions for her authenticity after that, but they did wonder why she claimed ignorance over what she did. She seemed scared after the fact. She had no idea what she had done.

She spent several years in Central City, having immediately gone into training for ARKS the first year. She became a model candidate for Force training, and dazzled everyone with her quick ascension through the grades. Essentially, she was raised by ARKS. But her distant and sometimes pretentious personality made her a target for bullies. This caused her to see the futility in friends, and she grew to prefer her own company over others. She had many other problems that she is unwilling to speak about.

Lumina became a very beautiful, very tall young woman, consequently placing her on a very high shelf for romantics. Her skills and photon pool have also grown with her, making her one of the stronger young ARKS in the city. She chose to develop herself further in an academic sense, and began training as a photon technician.

Currently, she can be found mulling over technology in Central City, or spending time out on the field for trials and general relaxation. Though the latter is more uncommon, as she is always very busy with her work, and her own intellectual pursuits.
