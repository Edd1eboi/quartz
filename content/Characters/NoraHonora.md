```ad-summary
title: Personality and details
<h4 align="center">Personality:</h4>

Nora could be characterized as a plethora of things; many would say that she's a *neurotic* piece of work that is *crude*, *mischievous* and *snarky*. 
However, she often is very oblivious to this, *e.g*:

> She'd eat a meal and say that it tastes bad, not due to her wanting to be mean or condescending - but because she doesn't think lying would be beneficial to the chef's development. Because, for her, food does not have any emotional connection to the chef. 

Though it is a nice underlying thought, she lacks the social know-how to express this in a good way without deeply offending most people, which inhibits her to befriend people that do not accept critique in a irrational way.

title: About Nora

<h5 align="center">Origins:</h5>


*[Nora Honora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)* awoke one day on a planet called *[Halpha](Places/Halpha.md)* after having crashed down in a pod. She was one of many so-called *[Meteorns](Concepts/Meteorns.md)*. After having been accustomed to her new surroundings and finding her way to the local café, *[Sugar Kitty](Places/Sugar%20Kitty.md)* where she met the owner, *[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md)*. After some time she started working with him.



<h5 align="center">The Housing Crisis:</h5>



[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md), having just arrived in the city, hadn't received housing since there'd be an issue filing the application and she was too embarrassed to bring it up with the commander, so she resorted to sleeping in the bushes, which wasn't too bad for her, though not optimal. 
[Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) noticed one day that she'd been sleeping in the bushes outside of the café and confronted Nora about this. Nora caved in and told him about her issues with finding housing and so [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) offered to let her sleep in his apartment with his sister, [Suyin](Characters/Suyin.md), and [Buster](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md), another Meteorn who'd not found housing. 


Later on [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) began calling [Nora Honora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md) and [Buster Dempsey](Characters/Buster%20Dempsey.md) her children due to the age differences. The two did not refuse the title and are now the foster children of [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md).

*[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)* began working at the café and usually takes the shifts that [Yazad](Characters/Yazad%20A.%20Heydar.md) can't take. She loves when customers asks for unique tea blends or blueberry pie! (Those are her favorites too.)

title: *Spoilers and unfinished content*: Nora's past
collapse: open

<h4 align="center">What she knows:</h4>

*[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)*, along with most other *[Meteorns](Concepts/Meteorns.md)*, can't remember much of her past. She has *vague* memories of her family spending time in cafés or restaurants, so she likes spending time at *[Sugar Kitty](Places/Sugar%20Kitty.md)*.

<h4 align="center">Her appearance:</h4>

Despite her appearance, *[Nora](Characters/Nora%20Honora.md)* is not a cat ~~nor a racoon~~, she's infact a genetic experiment where *[Gaia Stellaria](Characters/Gaia%20Stellaria.md)* spliced cat-DNA into her existing Deuman-DNA. The experiment that *[Gaia](Characters/Gaia%20Stellaria.md)* performed on her was mindbendingly painful and agonizing. Nowadays she doesn't remember the circumstances of her features due to the landing on *[Halpha](Places/Halpha.md)*, though being curious about it, it does not bother her too much.
