<h4 align="center">Background:</h4>

Expendable is a [Meteorn](Concepts/Meteorns.md), much like any other. But, the similarities end there, as she's unable to truly manifest Photons, and has to rely on redirecting what's ambient or tactically applying overwhelming force. This comes with the downside of being unable to use Photon Arts, although she can do them by rote and apply force where necessary, which is impressive given her age. Apart from her non-existent photon potential, and her ability to construct her own weapons using an unknown power, Expendable actually scores within average competencies apart from fieldcraft, where she excels. Through non-measurable metrics, she's considered the single luckiest entity in her class, with her results being statistically improbable, though demonstrable. She strives for excellence, not because she's stronger, but because she wants it more.
