<h4 align="center">Background:</h4>

A Meteorn who landed only about half a year ago, Molly's title 'Meteor' comes from a variety of sources. The most obvious being the fact that she is a Meteorn, but it goes a little deeper than that.

Molly's pod was ablaze when it broke through the atmosphere, several parts breaking off and crashing in different locations. One of those 'parts' ended up being Molly herself, as ARKS Defenders found the pod completely empty, finding the girl lying fast asleep (snoring very loudly) in an impact crater of her own, approximately 100 meters away.

ARKS assessed that the girl was unharmed by her horrific landing conditions because of her incredible photonic aptitude, paired with the fascinating gauntlets and boots she was equipped with that seemed to harness and control her explosive photon output. Despite being a useful teammate in a fight, Molly is reckless, loud, immature and... lacking in the brains department, but her impulsive nature makes her quick to improvise in the heat of combat.

The creator of her strange armaments was a mystery, but a note found tucked into one of her gloves on impact seems to give the girl a clear hint as to who it was. She holds it very closely and privately, scarcely bringing it up. All that's known to others is that the reverse side of the note bears an amazing recipe for rice pudding.
