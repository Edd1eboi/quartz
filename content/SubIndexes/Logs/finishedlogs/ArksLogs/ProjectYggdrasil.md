## ==================================

- **ID:** SAIKAGITSUNE_YOKAI
- **CLASS:** *YGGDRASIL ONSITE KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION AND INTELLIGENCE CAST* ([**Y.O.K.A.I**.](SubIndexes/Characters/Yokai.md))
- **MODEL:** 000 ALPHA
- **DESIGNATION:** SPECIAL OPERATIONS SQUAD LEADER
- **CALLSIGNS:** SAIKA, YOKAI

*"Originally purposed as forward operating scouts for the exploration of hostile and unexplored worlds under the direct overwatch of the Special Planetary Explorations Unit, Also refered to as ALTER; Project Yggdrasil aimed to reduce ARKS operative casualties within these extraordinarily dangerous situations by creating a special model of CAST unit specifically designed to take on these extremely harsh and dangerous situations. With the onset and resurgence of the Dark Falz and the subsequent wars that followed suit, Project Yggdrasil casts were repurposed and reassigned to multiple forward operating positions and combat roles within the ARKS military as a whole.*

*While not quite a small number of Project Yggdrasil casts were built, ranging somewhere in the mid 100's; most, if not all refer to eachother as some sort of family, or in the very least share some sort of familial bond with one another. Often times, even taking up the name of the project itself as their own surname: [YOKAI](SubIndexes/Characters/Yokai.md).*

*Model 000 Alpha; otherwise known as Saikagitsune as she would later call herself, was orginally a testbed platform for the subsequent generations of Yggdrasil casts that followed suit thereafter. As such, She has been integrated with a number of experimental subsystems which were designed to test their viability in the next generation of casts. While not all test systems proved beneficial, in the end, her use as a test bed was a vital step in the subsequent successes of the later generation Yggdrasil casts.*

*Following the start of the Darker Wars, Model 000 was reassigned to the Central Research Department, more commonly reffered to as VOID to undergo more experimental tests as well as modifications to better suit her needs as a soon to be frontline ARKS soldier. She would go on to lead a small force under the CRD to combat and sometimes capture Falz threats on the orders of VOID command.*

*After the third re-organisation in AP 239, Model 000 Alpha was once again reassigned, this time under the Combat Bureau where she spent the remainder of her ARKS career, that is until all records of here whereabouts were lost around a decade later."*

It is still unknown as of writing this document, of whether Model 000 Alpha is deceased, MIA, or for all intents and purposes, gone without a trace.
