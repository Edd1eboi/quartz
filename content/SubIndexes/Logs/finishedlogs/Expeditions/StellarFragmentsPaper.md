## Abstract

My goal with this paper is to take note of my findings regarding the static electric phenomena surrounding Stellar Fragments in [West Retem](SubIndexes/Places/Retem/Retem.md). They appear in correlation with sandstorms where thunder is present. These discharges from the sand/thunderstorms give them the ability to float around with no inhibition. 
The experiments ran showed that the possibilities for this technology appear to be rather grand.

## Introduction

The fragments appear to be of a material th	at allows them to be super-charged with static electricity, allowing them to float uninhibited in the air. 
The current understanding of Stellar Fragments at this point is lacking. So, my goal is to gain a deeper understanding of them and their potential for carrying electric charges. I've been investigating the phenomena of these fragments since they seem to have properties desirable for furthering our defense capabilities against the threat of DOLLs. 
I hypothesize that the Stellar Fragments are composed of materials that allow charges to be built similarly to batteries, just at a larger scale. Possibly useful for the mega-weapon the commander is constructing.

I approached the Stellar Fragments' experimentation with caution. It was crucial to sustaining the electric charge to study the material in its charged state, but also, once discharged, I sought to recharge them. It was done with extreme precaution since I'd noticed them violently discharge, or in layman's terms, explode. 

Due to the fragments' properties, I hope to utilize them as a large-scale battery for possible use in combat.

## Methods

#### Field description:
The items that I studied were Stellar Fragments, twenty of them. These samples were collected in [West Retem, by the Sagan Mountain Road: East Ryuker Device](SubIndexes/Places/Retem/Retem.md) (D/E2 on the map). The area that we collected the samples in had, like most other areas in [Retem](SubIndexes/Places/Retem/Retem.md), mostly sandy surroundings, with occasional patches of grass- or moss-like vegetation. Along with the aforementioned attributes, floating rocks were littering the area. They were floating for the same reason as the Stellar Fragments, I assume due to the static electricity. However, Stellar Fragments are different since they continued floating in the air. That being, even after I brought them outside of the affected area.

#### Sample Design:

I've decided that the sampling population is what most people would call Stellar Fragments; ergo, meteorite fragments containing crystal-like materials capable of carrying electric charges. These fragments appear every day, coinciding with the sandstorms and meteorites falling to the ground. 

I chose to collect 20 Stellar Fragments for experimenting on, which I divided into 4 test groups - 5 for control, 5 to test for a small electric charge, another 5 for a medium electric charge, and the last 5 for a large electric charge.
To be able to compare the fragments before and after the experiments, I kept a control group.
For the electric charge, I chose to charge the Stellar fragments for a period but with a small charge, to reduce the risk of spontaneous discharge. 
The timeframe I chose was around 20-minute intervals between "charging-step". 
So, the first step would be 20 minutes, then the next 40 minutes, and the last would be 60 minutes/1h.
The charge amount is the amount the Fragments individually let out - I quantify that as the factor that is the maximum charge amount, for now. 

- **Formula:**
(XÃ—P) / T = *Total Capacity*

**To clarify for replication purposes:**
"X" *(= Full capacity, as a function of P and Time)* amount of P *(= Power)* divided by T *(time)*, then charged up to a "full" amount, which would equal X again.

### Discussion

I believe that my hypothesis was answered. I've concluded from my experiments is that the Stellar Fragments can allow for a recharge after it's naturally degraded. From what I could tell, each fragment that successfully recharged was capable of the same things as a non-recharged fragment. It bodes well to the potential for creating tools dependent on another type of energy than photon-power, which is the current standard.
Proceeding from this, I believe that the course of action would be expanding the operation and recruiting more researchers. The potential of this technology is extraordinary.
