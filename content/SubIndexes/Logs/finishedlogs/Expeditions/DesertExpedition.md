#### [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md), leaning towards one of the beams of the bridge, sees **[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** cross over: "Hey there!"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Hey hey~" [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) covers her face as the desert air starts to blast her face "Ugh... it's worse now that I'm actually over the bridge..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah, it's really dusty - did you get a mask?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	She opens up a console on her MAG. "That along with some other things recommended for desert travel.-

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	It's still pretty stuffy so I thought I could hold out a little while longer before having to wear it..." She says as she

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	pushes a button on the console that changes her clothing for desert travel.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** begins chortling as she sees the hat: "Ahah~ The hat."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I heard the brim helps to keep the sun out of your eyes." She says as she starts faning herself.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I suppose that's a good usage." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) says, as she begins squinting at the rising sun.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"So where to from here? Should we explore the region or head straight into Retem?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I've been meaning to study the Stellar fragments found in North Retem." She says as she brings up a map to show where the location resides."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Never heard of Stellar Fragments, what are those?" She says as she views the map displayed from [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s MAG."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That's what I aim to find out." She says, sending over the map data to [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)'s mag.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I see you found a few Ryuker Devices too! I'd like to go visit and register my data with them on our way there"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That we can do!" [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) says, bringing her map down: "Follow me."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I believe the Stellar Fragments are electrically charged meteorite fragments, but I need to look up close to see."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"The local fauna is interesting."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I'd like to see how they taste along with the local flora~" [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) muses.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Particularly the sweet kind~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That we can do." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) looks at her map once-more: "Did you want to register the Ryuker device?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"My MAG's picking something up. So that's probably it."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yep-yep!"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Well, your MAG was probably picking this region MAG up."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Oh! It was the regional MAG~"

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/3.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It's big."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"All I see is dust... Just barely saw the trainia in the distance." She says as she squints her eyes.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** Pulls out her MAG and makes a note of it on her map.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Completely different feel from Aelio."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Lotta rocks that's for sure..." she says as she chuckles

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/6.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Very solid - let's go to the Ryuker Device then."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Yeah, let's. The sooner we check out those fragments, the sooner I can get out of this heat."

#### The two head to the Stellar Fragments hotspot.



**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I may have misplaced where I thought it was - the stellar fragments are here." She said from atop a floating rock.

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/5.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"More of these mysterious red boxes..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah, they're odd."

#### [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) Notices chirping at her feet.

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/7.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh my, birds."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Hey little ones~" [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) turns to [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md), "We probably scared off the mother."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** turns her attention back to the chicks: "Don't worry, we'll be out of here soon so you can get din din~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"The birds should be fine."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Try and get a few of those fragments."

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/DesertExpedition/Logs/6.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I think I picked up all the fragments nearby."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah, same."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Have you checked out the Oasis?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"No, I haven't. It's my first time being here. Though I have heard it's a popular spot for ARKS defenders."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"We can head to the city for a few moments before going, if you'd like~"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"If it's far, then yeah... I'd like to visit the city first to cool off." She says as she begins fanning herself again.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It's not too far, but we can cool off in the city."

*[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) uses the nearby Ryuker Device and heads to th-

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	**"Wait!""**

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Hm?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I haven't been to the city. Just gonna ditch me here?" She says in a jovial tone.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh! Right."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Follow me, I suppose." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) says in an apologetic tone.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** puts a hand on her hip and chortles: "Haha, lead the way~" She says in an amused tone.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I believe you should be able to see it from here..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Let's soar~" [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) said as she lept off the cliff.

#### The two soar over to Retem City.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** seats herself on the edge of one of the shop-platforms: "Better?" 

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/8.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Ugh! Stupid sandstorm! Now I got sand in places I didn't know I could get sand!" She exclaims as she starts knocking sand off her outfit.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** chuckles at the unadjusted one's frustrations: "You'll get used to it."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"At least I'm out of the heat and in more bareable temperatures."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** takes off her mask to enjoy the more hospitable atmosphere of Retem City.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** follows **[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**'s example: "That's better indeed."

#### [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) runs off and goes to the store.

#### **[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** comes back with a juice bottle from the store.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Thirsty? I know I am." [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) hands over a strawberry juice bottle.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** lazily grabs the juice bottle and screws it open: "Thanks~"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** plops down on the edge of the platform enjoying her juice.
 
 **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** carefully sips her own juice: "It's good..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "I like sitting by the amphitheatre, though here's good aswell."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"You know... Retem City's pretty simple yet multi-functional at the same time." She says while lazily sipping at her drink, "As you mentioned, it's shaped like an ampitheatre, but I think it's also shaped this way to keep the heat out."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh I see."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I was thinking the exterior sort of looks like a rocket engine or something."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Might be that too when you think about it."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"You think I think?" [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) chuckled.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I thought you thunk~" she chortles.

##### **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** giggles quietly whilst struggling to drink her juice.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**: lightly elbows [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md):  "Ey! I heard there's a pretty awesome place with a view to chill out at. Wanna check it out in a bit?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah, we can go now if you'd like."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Let's go then~"

#### **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** sipped the last of her juice and stood up.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Lead the way cowgirl."

#### The two climb atop the giant engine that is Retem City. 

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** sits down: "Damn, the metal is hot." 

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Oh yeah~ This is a nice view... **AT NIGHT!**" 

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/9.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

#### **[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** gets up and starts patting her butt down of the heat.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Ooof... that's hot..."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Still have to agree about the view though."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah, view's great."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** sets her eyes on the nearby Pyramid: "You wanna go there?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Sure~ Let's~"

#### **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** takes a running starts and begins flying to it.

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/10.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Over here," [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) says, "There's a Ryuker Device!"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Okay, I'm registered here~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh man..." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) sees the oncoming sandstorm: "Might be an idea to put on your mask."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"*Pffft...* I put that stupid thing on the moment we flew into the desert"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Fair enough." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) said as she flew towards the top of the pyramid.

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/12.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

#### The two both land on the top of the pyramid.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I've gotta say, I think the view's even better from here."

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/14.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/13.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"At least there's some shade to work with here. Even though it feels like I'm playing musical chairs with the sun."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** laughs at the remark: "Yeah, it's difficult finding a cool place, but I feel like the wind up here helps alot."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** pulls her hat off to fan her face for a bit "Still though, the view is a lot better from up here."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah, it really is."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"By the way, you mentioned something about an oasis?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** stands and admires the day's last light hitting the peaks of the cliffs and dunes: "Yeah, it's over there."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	She points to a little oasis not too far from the trainia.

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/15.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** squints her eyes to look off into the distance "I... think I see a large body of water that way..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah, wanna head there?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Yep! Let's~"

#### [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) and [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md), yet again, leap and soar.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It looks magical." She said, the two standing infront of the small water-source.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Wow~ it's so pretty~"

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/16.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"The sky's different from [Aelio](SubIndexes/Places/Aelio/Aelio.md) for some reason."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"What are those lights in the sky I wonder..."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"No way they can be meteors."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I think they are."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Too bad they aren't all meteorns. More reinforcements wouldn't a bad thing" She chuckles.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** chuckles back: "I've always found it strange that we're called meteors. It would make more sense to be called meteorites since we've landed."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Hmm... so we'd be meteoriteans?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"That sounds like a mouthful" she laughs.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It does, but I like to pick on 'Meteor Molly' by calling them Meteorite Molly." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) giggled.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Aww... that sounds mean. It sounds like you're picking on her height" She laughs. "Though I think I know who you're talking about, but it has been a long while since I've met her."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Ah, it's not that, they're just on the ground." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) chuckled, "They have a lacking understanding of scientific definitions and their lack of it makes them seem like a dunce." she continued, in a thick coat of sarcasm.

#### **[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**'s enjoying the last bits of the night air then notices the huge moon to the east.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Oh Geez! That thing's huge!! How could I have missed that from Aelio?!?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I've seen it before, but I usually only notice it around Lake Halpha."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Everything about this place feels wrong, it's all seemingly constructed."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"What makes you think that?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"You know by the bridge between here and Aelio?" She says and pauses shortly, "If you follow along down the river - you can see beams prodding out, looking like they were meant to be connected. And you can see the same types of beams in South Aelio in the caves."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Huh... I always figured it was some construction project that was abandoned along time age due to the DOLLS invasion."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"You'd think that, but why is it so far spread?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I dunno, I'm no engineer."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It's especially suspicious that we can't remember anything - which makes me suspect that there's something wrong with the area that doesn't allow us to and not that we hit our head too hard during landing."


**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"But what if we were put in stasis for a long time? Not many meteorn pods came with a history of what they were in a previous life."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Other than being a stasis pod, mine had very little data in it. Or so the people in Central Aelio's medical facility tells me."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah, same for me. I just think that it's odd that we all have collective amnesia regarding the past."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I think most meteorns are using both the amnesia and their new life on this planet as an opportunity to make a new identity for themselves." She nods to herself, "Yep, that way of thinking works fine for me too."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It's just frustrating not knowing what I, and others have lost."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Well I think for some, that might be for the best" She says as she gets up from her seat. "Anyone that is capable of turning into a one-man army suddenly after waking up one day, probably has a past that's best forgotten."

![DE](https://github.com/Edd1ee/The26thArksDivision/blob/hugo/content/Images/Logs/DesertExpedition/17.png?raw=true?style=centerme)

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Anyways, I have things I need to take care of back in [Central City](SubIndexes/Places/Aelio/CentralCity.md) and report in for the day."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** acknowledges **[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**'s reasoning and nods: "Yeah, I'll leave with you."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Thanks for guiding me around [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)!" She says with a smile in her eyes.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Thank you for helping me conduct my research~"


**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Anytime~"

#### [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) opens up her MAG's console and initializes the Central Aelio teleportation sequence.

#### [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) nods and brings her own MAG up too and flees to Central Retem: "See ya~"

#### **[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** vanishes in a beam of light as she is recalled to Central Aelio's Ryuker Device.
