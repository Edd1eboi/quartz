**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Hiya **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**!!"

### ***[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)*** *sees* ***[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)*** *approaching:* "Hey Ross~"


**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "How's it going?"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "R-Ross!?! Why that name??" she says, replying in protest.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Rose- Ross, similar enough."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Gender is a social construct that doesn't have any beneficial purpose to society--"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "N-No its not!! Ross is a boy's name!" *Rosie says, fuming.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:  "Fine I'll call you Rosie." *She said, noticing her fumes.*

#### *Rosie puffs her cheeks out in annoyance.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "You'll learn about this later in school." *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) chuckled.*

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Well I happen to like my name" *She said with pride and a smile.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "That's fortunate~"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Hehe~ Anyways, I came in for something to eat. What's on the menu?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Ah, right~ I don't work at the cafe anymore."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Oh really? That's too bad...."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Yeah, I had a falling ou- Oh?"

#### *[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) thought she saw something moving in the bushes and turns to look.*

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Hmm?!"

#### *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)  approached the bush*: "Who resides here?"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Blub blub"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Umm... hello...??"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "I don't think fishes are meant for bushes." *She said, pulling [Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)'s fin-ears.*

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Ah!"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "What the hell, skunk girl"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "That's my spot, dummy."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I know. That's why I took it"
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "It smells nice."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "There are literally- Oh."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Umm... hello there."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Oh right, have you met **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**, Rosie?"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "No... this is the first time I've met her."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: *She whispers to Rosie*: "She's a little crazy, but that's okay~"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "I'm Rosie! Rosie Clements! Who might you be?"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Hello, little child."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I'm Lady **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)** of Atlantis"
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "You can call me **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)** though."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Oh! Nice to meet you Ms. **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Miss.. Finally being addressed with the respect I deserve"
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Thank you little one."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Shut up Lily."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Don't be crude **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**, you don't want to scare your new friend away"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "I've known Rosie for a while actually~"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Yep! Yep!" *Rosie Nodded.*

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Well, good to see you hang out with someone your age for once."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Oh shut it, fish lady."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "So **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**... since you're a *lady*... does that mean you're royalty?"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Yes, somewhere I am royalty, not here though really."
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "At least, nobody here acknowledges my status. Annoyingly enough..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "She's a [Meteorn](SubIndexes/Concepts/Meteorns.md) like me."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that... it must be hard knowing you're so far from home..."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Yes, not only is it far away from home, but I'm also stuck on land"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "There's water like 3 meters from where you're standing."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "I don't think she means that kind of water Norraa~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Not my fault." **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** snorts out.

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I mean. The sea."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "That's like a kilometer out--"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Yeah! There's plenty of water to the west or south of here!"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Yeah, even in the north-east."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Yeah but there's no sea people in there."
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "and no buildings. or roads."
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "It's just water. Really weird."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Is that what Atlantis is like?"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Yes. It's a city like this, but underwater."
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I don't remember that much else about it though... Like most people here"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Did you walk around in Atlantis?"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Yeah! Or did you swim around? Maybe even had your own cars?" *She asks, with wonder in her eyes.*

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Either works. Depends on what you're feeling."
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "We had cars, kinda, more like pods. But I crashed like a bunch of my dads pods so he banned me from using them"
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I think anyways, kinda hazy memory. Maybe it was just one."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Maybe it was just the one before you ended up on [Halpha](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md)?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "We can't really know, can we?"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "I guess not..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "I, along with **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**, can't remember much from before, only glimpses of the past."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Yeah. I don't know the veracity of anything I might think I remember. It kinda sucks. But, at least I'm not burdened by my past."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "So it's kind of like having a clean slate to work with then!"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Exactly. I suppose it's sad in a way, not remembering your family wholly, but at least you can be a whole new person."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Who knows, I might've been a megalomaniac~"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "You're just a little kid. You were probably eating dirt or something."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "You certainly have the capacity for it **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**~" Rosie chides playfully

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Oh- Well- You can't bully me like this."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: *She imitates [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s voice*: "Om-nom-nom, dirt so yummy, **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** like-y."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "I will grind dirt in your eyes, old lady." **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** said, picking up a handful of dirt menacingly.

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: Rosie gigles at **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**'s immitation "Hehe... I don't think **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**'s that bad..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "I wouldn't just eat --any-- old dirt, it'd have to be of the finest quality."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)** pulls out her sunglasses "Try it, squirrel."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Umm... maybe the dirt would be put to better use for planting flowers instead?"

#### **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** puts on the glasses: "Is this what you wanted?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Perhaps, if you're a lowly dirt-consumer, but I, **[Nora Honora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**, know the fine art of eating dirt."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "You look nice with the- w-wait what?" *Rosie stuttered at [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s dirt eating remark.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "What?"

#### *[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md) pulls out another pair of glasses and puts them on:* "Yes."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Why do you have so many glasses?"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I had a hard time adapting to life above the sea, it was hard to see things - so I got a lot of glasses."
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I'm used to it now though."

#### *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) takes the glasses off and casts them to [Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)*: "That's fair enough."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)** *Puts all the glasses back in her pockets.*

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "So **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**, how old are you if you remember?"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I believe one or two thousand years,  I'm not sure though."
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I believe we fish people age much slower than you warm blooded folks."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Gosh, so you're eternally annoying?"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I will haunt you forevaaaa~"
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Or, until you die, and I'm still alive."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "That's kind of sad when you think about it."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Yeah, so make sure you don't annoy me too much so I can remember you fondly."
**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Because I will remember you forevaaaaaaa~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "If you say you're around two thousand years old then that means I've lived for less than a percent of your lifespan."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Anyways, how old are you, little Rosie"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "I'm thirteen!"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "That's pretty close to **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**'s age. Which is good. There's not an abundance of kids around here."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "*Close-?!* That's not close!"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I mean.. From my perspective..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "*fRoM mY PeRsPEcTive*- Shush." *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) said mockingly.*

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Huh.... I guess thirteen and seventeen would be pretty close to someone who can live for a thousand years..."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I literally don't even remember being either of your ages. It was that long ago."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "You don't remember anything."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I remember what I did to- uh nevermind."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "To?"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "ANYWAYS."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "No-- I wanna hear this."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I need to go.. uh..-"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "You're not going anywhere."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "I promised to water-- Someone's uh...- Fish. So yeah, bye. *[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md) hastily stands up and runs away.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "God damn it."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Oh! Bye Ms. **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**t"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "I guess she really had to leave..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "She's hiding something."
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "She never told me how she got those legs either."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Why? Is that not normal for her?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Apparently not, and when I asked her she said that I don't want to know what she did to get those legs."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Sounds like the hook for a fairy tale..." or a horror story."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Yeah- Oh, hey there again." *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) saw [Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md) running back.*

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Oh! Welcome back Ms. **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**!"


**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Hello little babies."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Now tell me how you got 'em legs."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Alright I'm leaving again."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "No no!"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "It's okay! You don't have to if it's private to you!" *Rosie said, reassuringly.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "It's suspicious..."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "It might be painful to recall too..."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Exactly, Rosie. Glad someone around here taught you good manners."

#### *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) menancingly brings up the dirt from the ground again:* "It ***best*** be something personal..."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: Rosie smiles at **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**'s praise "My mom taught me this and some of the shows I watch"

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Oh, what shows? My little photon? I love that show."

#### *[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md) side-eyes [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)*: "Found a snack, I see."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "*Shut*."

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Yeah! It's a great show on friendship I think!"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Mhm."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "That's one good thing about this place. All the good shows."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "I take it that there weren't many shows in Atlantis."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "No shows at all - no visiphone or *bisiphone* or whatever you kids call it."

#### *Rosie's MAG began ringing, interrupting the conversation.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Oh, what's that?"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Uh oh!"

#### *Rosie then open's up the MAG's projected keyboard and starts typing something in.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Hm?!"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Hey... sorry but I have to go soon! I promised to finish up an errand for my parents and they're asking where I'm at."

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "So responsible of you, see you later little Rosie."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "I see, it was nice catching up with you~"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "I'll be back here later if I get the okay from my parents."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Alright!~"

**[RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Bye now! Nice meeting you **[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**!"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Bye, little lady!" *she said, waving.*

**[Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)**: "Nice meeting you little one!"

#### *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) and [Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md) remained sitting in the grass for a few moments, before parting aswell.*
