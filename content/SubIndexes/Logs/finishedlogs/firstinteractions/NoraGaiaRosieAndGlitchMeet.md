#### Participants: *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md), [RO-C](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md), Glitch, [Gaia Stellaria](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)*


#### Place: [Halpha](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md), [Central City](SubIndexes/Places/CentralCity.md), by the park next to the caf√©.

### **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** approaches Rosie, who's sat on a picnic cloth:
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Hey there little one~"


**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Oh hi [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)!" Rosie says as she waves in [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s direction

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Why are you sat here?"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"The sun felt nice today, so I'm having a picnic!" Rosie says with a smile.
**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Wanna join me? I have a few sandwiches left."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s face lights up**: "A picnic?~ I'd love a sandwich." She seats herself next to the little CAST.

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) reaches into the basket and offers [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) a simple sandwich of sliced Aelio meats, lettuce, and tomato**: "I wasn't sure how long I'd be out here, so I made a few extras. You're welcome to them."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** hastily grabs it and begins chomping down on it: "Thisch tasthsches.. gh-great!"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Why thank you! It's nice hearing that from you since you used to be the one to give me food." She says cheerily.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Mm-mm! Did you make them yourself?" [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) said, having finished her sandwich.

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Yeah... Though it's not really much, just some stuff I put together from the refridgerator." She says slightly embarrased.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) lightly smacks Rosie's head and says in a teasing manner**: "Oh, don't be so humble!~"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Uweh~" she blurts out in response to the playful impact.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Now-now - where'd you learn to make such great sandwiches?"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"My Mother taught it to me."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Right... I wonder how my mother was..."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Oh... you don't have any memory of her do you?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"No, not really."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Sorry to hear that..."
**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Do you remember anything about yourself before you landed on Halpha?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh, don't be! She might've been a serial killer for all I know..."

[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) sighs deeply: "Can't really say that I can remember much."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) turns to Glitch's direction**: "Uh... Glitch? Is that you?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) looks over where [Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)'s looking**: "Huh, I suppose it is."

**Glitch:**	"Oh, hello again!"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Want to come sit with us?"

**Glitch:**	"Sure, I'm not doing anything else right-ight-ight now."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Did you ever figure out your name?"

**Glitch:**	"Me? I think-k-k Glitch has stuck at this point."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah, I remember you talking about not being able to remember it."

**Glitch:**	"My memory is-is-is still compromized. Just little flash-ash-ashes."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) sighs**: "You and me both."

**Glitch:**	"Still managing to sur-ur-urvive despite everything. I'm a reasonably competent ARKs Defender."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That's great to hear."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"How is Mr. Montegue? I have some sandwich meat he can have if he eats that kind of stuff."

**Glitch:**	"Mr. Montague is doing well. He's-e's-e's-e's-e's taken to hanging around with the other cats over behind the salon."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh right, Mr. Montague! I'd forgotten about him~"

**Glitch:**	"Mr Montague is a very indepen-pen-pen-pendant cat. I'm fairly comfortable leaving him to his own devices when I'm out in the field."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I see~"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Oh? Were you out helping with the recent DOLLS alert?"

**Glitch:**	"I was in another area keeping an optical sensor on-n-n-n-n-n things while the big heroes were handling the alert."
**Glitch:**	"I don't want to get in the way, what with my crashing issue."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Crashing? I hope you've had that looked at."

**Glitch:**	"From what I've been told it's a common issue with CASTs over 200 years old. It's called Instant Crash Syndrome."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"That sounds awful... are you okay after it happens?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah... Doesn't sound pleasant at all."

**Glitch:**	"A lit-it-it-it-it-ittle disoriented but otherwise fine. It really becomes an issue if it happens in a fight."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I can imagine."

**Glitch:**	"It's why I stay off the frontlines. I d-d-d-don't want to become a liability."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Is there anything that can be done?"

**Glitch:**	"Not really. It won't kill me but I'm st-t-t-tuck with it regardless."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Seems like fortune in the disfortune."

**Glitch:**	"Seems that way. I just hope it doesn't-n't-n't get worse the older I get."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Would hope that it is that way."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Umm... since you're old. Why don't you just retire? That's what my grandfather after doing work for many years." [Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) asks innocently.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) lightly smacks Rosie again and in hushed voice whispers**: "That's rude!~"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Uwah~ I'm sorry..." She apologizes while holding her metal hair.

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**: "Good thing my hair doubles as a helmet too..."

**Glitch:**	"I don't want to sit idle. Even though I crash every so often I'm still able to function the rest of the time."
**Glitch:**	"I don't -feel- old...At least as much as I understand of how other people describe it."
**Glitch:**	"I may never feel old. I've always been a CAST. I wasn't anything else bef-f-f-f-fore that."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Must be strange."

**Glitch:**	"To me it's normal. I have no bas-as-as-asis for comparison."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Y- yeah."

**Glitch:**	"I hope I haven't derailed the conversation you were having before."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Oh no... we we're just enjoying the outdoor air.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Mhm~"

**Glitch:**	"Any time it's not raining is good-d-d-d weather to me."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"I don't think it ever rains inside of Central. Does rain make your problems worse?"

**Glitch:**	"No, the sensation of rain hitting my casing is jus-ust kinda unpleasant."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Oh! I think I can relate. On the rare times I'm allowed outside of of the city. It feels weird when something like rain hits

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	my head constantly."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) raises an eyebrow**: "It just feels like a shower~"

**Glitch:**	"It's difficult-t-t-t to explain. It's a CAST thing."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That makes sense."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Yeah, what Glitch said." [Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) says with a giggle.

**Glitch:**	"It can be quiet distracting. Reminds me of this one time in the forest. I was so distracted I got ambushed by *boomas*."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"A-- what?"

**Glitch:**	"*Boomas*. They're-... Hmm... ...Oh, it's one of those memory flashes..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh, that's interesting."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"I've-- never heard of a *Booma*. What are they? Do you remember?"

**Glitch:**	"They're... *...Hmm..*. ...Nope, it's gone again."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"When you mentioned it, I thought you were talking about those DOLLs with bombs strapped to their backs."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh right, like the ones who keep blowing up the mining rigs." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) lets out a sigh of frustration just at the thought.

**Glitch:**	"No... no, these weren't DOLLs, I remember that much."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Perhaps they're similar to creatures in the forest that aren't DOLLs?"

**Glitch:**	"Hmmm... ...Native, weak to fire element attacks... ...That's all I c-c-c-can recall."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Interesting..."

**Glitch:**	"...Stronger ones nearer to *the dome*..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Right, you talked about a *dome*."

**Glitch:**	"There was a pillar... ...One of three..."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) looks to [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Does any of this sound familiar to you?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Nope."
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Only thing that's familiar is what I've heard from Glitch before."

**Glitch:**	"Three pillars to open the door....Down in the dark....SHOULD-D-D-D-DN'T HAVE LET-ET-ET-ET-ET IT OUT!"  

### Glitch overloads and crashes, rendering them unconcious.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That doesn't-- Are you alright?!" [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) says and lets out a yelp.

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Glitch! Are you okay??"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) approaches the crashed CAST and kneels**: "Must've crashed?"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Is she okay [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I'd hope so."

### Having heard some commotion, [Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) walked over to inspect the scene.


**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Well she did say she's able to recover from her crashes..."

**Glitch clicks back on**: "I'd-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d like to purchase ten *trimate* please-"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s ear twitched from the oncoming footsteps**: "Oh hello there! Do you happen to know-- Oh, would you look at that."

**Glitch Looks around:** "Oh... Hey."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Welcome back Glitch! I'm glad you're okay!" Rosie says happily.

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"*Trimate*...why does that sound familiar?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"You recognize it?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Only the kind of recognize where I think I used to know of it before my memory loss."

**Glitch:**	"Trimate is... ...Hm. Gone again."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I see, it seems to be the same with you and Glitch then."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"And a ton of other Meteorn, allegedly."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"What's a *Trimate*?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Something Meteorn probably were familiar before stasis and its side-effects."

**Glitch:**	"Do you also remember a dome?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) looks to Glitch:** "Dome?"

**Glitch:**	"Hm...Nev-ev-ev-evermind..."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Naw, naw, what specifically?"

**Glitch:**	"I have flashes of memory; there was a forest and a dome."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"And so-called '*boomas*'?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"*Boomas*...?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Some sort of creature."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Huh..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"You recognize it?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Nope."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Hm..."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"I do recognize the *Rockbears*,  'cause a part of me feels like I've been very familiar with them in the past."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"*Rockbears*? Do you mean cragbear?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Did I say *rockbear*...?"

**Glitch:**	"I k-k-k-keep expecting them to belch up fireballs."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Fireballs from a Cragbear? Aren't they scary enough??"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) blinks, surprised**: "Weird, rockbear felt more natural to say."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I suppose it would make sense... they have rocks... and are bears... *Wait*, what even are bears?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"They *are*, silly."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Maybe there are water bears...?"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)	Looks to [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "What are bears?"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Are you referring to Cragbears and Rockbears in general?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Why do you question the bear part? Clearly thats their species. The rock part is just an affix?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I've only seen cragbears..."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"And maybe the other regions have other elements?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Perhaps."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Hmm... I wonder what a bear in Retem would look like?"

**Glitch:**	"Close to the dome... Native creature... *Hildebear*..."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Salt bear" She says and snickers.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Retem... Right, have you been to Retem - Miss Purple?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"No, theres a barrier erected and I guess you need special access to get through?"

**Glitch:**	"Are there forests in Retem?"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Now Hildebear? Uhh.... so many bears..." Rosie says holding her head.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) examined the tall lady up and down**:	 "Oh! You just looked very militant so I thought you were a high-ranked ARKs officer."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)'s face sours. Admittingly with a tinge of hyperbole, like shes sarcastic**: "You don't know my name?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Uhh.... Nope!"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"This is the first time we've met."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"No... it is not."

**Glitch:**	"I keep out of the big-name Arks defender's way."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Huh?" [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) tilts her head in confusion.

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"I don't think big-name arks have that much time to muck about with grunts."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"You mean to say that we've met before?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Yep."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Fish friend included."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh! [Lilit](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md)!"

**Glitch:**	"***IaPkRu***, is that-t-t-t you?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"We hung out in the cafe and that annoying as heck redhead kept butting in?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Hm... I vaguely remember it. I think there was a lot going on in the cafe so I might've just ran to another customer."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Lots of impressions - y'know? Difficult to remember."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"I remember it clear as day."

**Glitch:**	"Redhead? Short? Dressed in black latex?"


**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) shook her head:** "No, no latex. I'd probably remember if someone was wearing something striking like that." She says  wrinkling her nose.

**Glitch:**	"Only redhead that comes to mind."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"The old lady?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Old lady? I don't know about that... I tried to pay her no attention. Which was....difficult."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I think she was around forty - *Jumike? Yumichigo? Yumiko*... was it?"
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"She's made a few appearances-- in, uhm... least said, daring outfits."

**Glitch:**	"Forty is old?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Uhm, yeah?!"

**Glitch:**	"I must be ancien-en-en-ent..."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	*She looks at **Glitch:**.* 'Age is relative to race, health and biology, to be honest.'

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Hmm... I think my Dad refers to it as Past prime age. He thinks old age like 60's and higher."


**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) looks back at [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Hmm, Yumi-something. I don't remember. Whatever. My name is [Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md), since you forgot."


**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Nice to meet you **[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:, again - the name's [Nora Honora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)~"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"I know..." She walks up to [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) and bonks her on the head.


**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) yelps as she's bonked:** "Well-- in case you didn't!"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Hi [Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md), I'm [Rosie Clements](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)! Nice to meet you!"


**Glitch:**	"People call me Glitch. I don't-t-t-t recall what I was called before, but it sort of fit-it-it-it-its."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"I am sure that a CAST technician could fix your speech atleast."

**Glitch:**	"They already tried."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Bad technicians, then?"

**Glitch:**	"It's tied to my ICS and nobody can fix that either."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Regardless of what its tied to, there are voice-boxes capable of ungarbling glitched speech."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"But you do you. The choice exists."

**Glitch:**	"It's nothi-thi-thing to do with the voicebox, it's my code. Parts that can't be touched without seriously messing me up."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Uh-huh. It's your choice to just accept it as is. I myself don't believe anything *can't* be done without serious harm. Its just about finding out how to do it safely." She nodded to herself in affirmation.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Spoken like a scientist!" She said, eyes lighting up.

**Glitch:**	"I've got time for someone to fig-ig-igure out how. Not like I'm going to die of old-d-d-d age any time soon."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Perhaps, but software faults can develop on their own! Especially with photons involved."

**Glitch:**	"I'm aware. They explained that-t-t to me when I was diagnosed with ICS."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Right."

**Glitch:**	"I'm old whether I feel it or not."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) looks at the trio in sequence as silence befalls**: "Nice weather, huh? Even if the shield kinda cheats it."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"So Miss [Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md), [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) said something about you speaking like a scientist - Are you one?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Oh."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Yes, I am. I have a hand in a bit of every field, but mostly bioscience."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh really?~ What sorts of things do you do in bioscience?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Genetics."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Hm..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) thinks for a minute before falling silent.**

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"What?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) looks down at the ground**: "Well... I've been thinking about how I got these things." She said, wiggling her ears and tail.

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"I mean, you and me both." She waggled her tail back and forth, brushing against the grass.

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"So you're a [meteorn](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md#^Meteorns) too?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) snickered**: "Haha, I thought that was clear, since I hinted at failing memory. My bad."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It was worth a try..."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) giggles**: "It would probably make Central news if there was an amnesiac that wasn't a [meteorn](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md#^Meteorns)!"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) smirked and said**: "That or they hit a rock without dying."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) smiled**:	"Yeah, but at least they'd have a background history. Maybe..."

**Glitch:**	"Having memor-or-or-ories that made sense would be nice."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Most meteorn do too and if we try hard we can kinda figure out tidbits through other memories."
**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"I have started puzzling together some things."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh really?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Your body can remember things you don't really remember on a surface level of memories."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Something like muscle memory?"

**Glitch:**	"Metal memory in-n-n my case."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) giggles at Glitch's joke.**

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Kinda, yeah. I found it incredibly easy to learn how to build machines and working with lab equipment."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Like I had familiarity. Same with studying, some subjects just kind of absorbed instantly."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Huh... Could explain why I had such an easy time in the cafe."

**Glitch:**	"I was just thinking how skill-ill-illfully you threw that chair into the pond,

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) laughs softly at Glitch's joke.**

**Glitch:**	"Muscle memory of throwing furniture into bodies of water!"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Cats must be scary where you're from [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)~"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) She looks back at [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md):** "In theory, finding out about your additional doodads is easy."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"And in practice?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"My first thought was that you have cat genes. But I don't think *-that-* species of cat is around."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Well could you somehow extrapolate my geneology?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"I could, that's all fair and dandy. But without a similar species to compare with I can't really get a good result."


**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Why can't you subtract instead?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Subtract?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Take my genes and compare them to the 'average' gene-set and replace the ones that stand out as non-deuman?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"You want the ears and tail gone?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I mostly want to know if it's possible."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"It is. But you'd probably become half-deaf and lose a lot of your balance."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Hm."
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"And there'd be no way to replace the genes with other people's genes?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Your body has probably developed the ears and tail as a reaction to the gene, which caused it to develop them to gain the abilities the genes dictate that the species needs to survive."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	'Are you looking to become someone else?'

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Hm..."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"I am a scientist; I am obligated to tell you anything is possible."

**Glitch:**	"Possib-ib-ible? Yes. Ethical? ...Debatable."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"It's the process of doing things is where the issue resides."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"You think it'd be painful to do it?"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Without a doubt, yes."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Not to mention a very spooky sense of phantom limbs, or whatever."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) sighs**: "I suppose I'd have to think about it."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"Why would you want to change who you are [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I am who I am regardless of my body."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Yeah but you'd be you with a considerable loss of hearing and permanent drunkness, balance-wise."

**Glitch:**	"Changes t-t-t-to the body can change the person. Even CAST have this happen."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"It's not a video game salon, you cant just remove and add."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I don't think we should go into a discussion of the sense of -I-, but regardless I'm heavily leaning towards not doing it then."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Good. Procedures involving amputation are messy."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)**:	"It sounds like more trouble than it's worth. Besides, I like you the way you are right now you know?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) chuckles**: "Why thank you, [Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) smiles back warmly in response.**

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) checks her MAG**: "Oh! Looks like I've been out for awhile now. I better head back."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Send my regards to your parents~"

**Glitch:**	"Nice to see you again-n-n."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) starts picking up her blanket and folds it into her basket.**

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"You've got a curfew-..." *She blinks* "It explains the child-like presentation?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh yeah, [Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md)'s tiny."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) replies with a smile**: "Yeah, I'm only thirteen, so I'm allowed some freedom around [Central](SubIndexes/Places/CentralCity.md), but I still have to keep in touch with my parents."

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) finishes gathering her belongings and looks back to the group**:	"Bye everyone~ It was nice meeting you Ms. **[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:~"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**: "Well then. It was nice meeting you, miss Clements."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"See ya some other time, [Ross](SubIndexes/Logs/finishedlogs/firstinteractions/LilitROCsFirstInteraction.md#^00bbb3)!"

**[Rosie](SubIndexes/Characters/RO-C.md) sighs at [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s prodding then smiles mischievously**: "I'll see you later... *Nose*~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Who are you callin- Oh, okay." **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) watches the tiny CAST walk away.**

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Well then."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"She had good sandwiches."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Is that so? Seems like a sweet gal. Good of you to be her friend."

**Glitch:**	"I'll take your wo-ord-ord-ord for it."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"She's nice, but very curious of the ARKs-- which can be concerning at times..."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Yeah, considering how violent it can get."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah."

**Glitch:**	"A healthy curiousity can be a good thing. I d-d-d-don't think I've ever been told anything is classified."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"If its classified you probably wouldnt know its a thing to begin with."

**Glitch:**	"I suppose you're right. After all, I'm jus-us-ust a grunt."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It's not good for a child to watch fighting videos though."


**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Yeah, its mostly a need to know basis. And most ARKS are not in a need to know, just do."

**Glitch:**	"I'm not even-en-en on the front lines due to my ICS."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Then what do you do within ARKS?"

**Glitch:**	"I keep the peace in quieter-er-er-er areas."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"So...you're more a patrol unit?'"

**Glitch:**	"More or less. Sometimes they have me keep the Rappies out of mischief."

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	Suppose Rappy herder is one kind of work. They are the mascots of ARKS after all."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) just stands there, thinking of all the rappies she has violently slaughtered.**

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) has slain quite a few. A fact she hides behind a solid poker face.**

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) nervously lets out a**: "Yeah-ha-ha, rappies, they're-- very cute... Yeah!~"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"*Aaaanyhow*, It was nice chatting. I am gonna take my leave again~"

**Glitch:**	"They're harmless-ess-ess. The most they'll do is sing to you. I mostly keep them from climbing on the mining rigs."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Till we meet again~"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md) nods**: "Pleasure meeting you both - Take care, will ya?"

**Glitch:**	"Try not to science t-t-t-t-t-t-t-too hard."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) chuckles and says**: "Well can't promise you that~"

**[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)**:	"Gotta science hard to get anywhere. If there is a loud boom, it might be me~' - She says as she turns around while waving goodbye.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Bye science lady!" - [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) yells behind her.
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) turns back to Glitch**: "Well, I suppose I should get back home."
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"This cat needs a nap."

**Glitch:**	"People are so focused on keeping the rigs safe from DOLLs but the Rappies like to press buttons."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Mhm."

**Glitch:**	"Oh...Sleep-p-p-p-p well."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It was nice talking to you again, it'd been awhile~"

**Glitch:**	"I try to keep busy, but I'll make a point of dropping by more of-of-often."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Please do~"


### [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) waved as she walked away.
