---

#### Participants: [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) and [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md).

#### Place(s): [Halpha](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md), [Central City](SubIndexes/Places/CentralCity.md), by the caf√© & Retem Bridge.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Oh Hiya **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**!"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) greets back, slightly muffled**:	"Hey Yumyum!~"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"So what's up with you?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) takes off her mask**: "Well, I've got an assignment by the commander - to go to Retem."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Oh yeah? I heard command wanted defenders to investigate Retem. I haven't recieved orders for it yet though."
**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I was about to grab a bite to eat from the cafe. Wanna join me for a bit?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah sure!~"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Nice! Lemmie get them sweets~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Mm." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) hummed and followed suit.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"*Mmm*~ Let's see what they got today~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** leered over [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)'s shoulder and pondered if she should get anything: "*Hm*... hmm**...!**"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I'll just go with a banana mango strawberry smoothie~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I'll just have an iced tea, I think."

#### [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) enters in the orders via the console and makes her way to a nearby table. [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) promptly follows along and takes a seat.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"So you haven't gotten the order to go there yet?~"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Oh! Are you heading to Retem right now?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I've actually snuck in a little to check the weather, but it was blazing hot."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Ugh... I **HATE** hot weather..." she said, emphasizing the word hate.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Contrary to popular belief, you're not supposed to dress lightly in the desert, in fact you're supposed to cover everything."
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It's to keep your moisture in so you don't die of dehydration~"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"*Wha???* That sounds like the opposite of what you want to do in hot weather!"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It's better to cover your skin from the sun so you don't get burned~"
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It's also so that your sweat gets absorbed in the fabric and cools you down!"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"That sounds like special equipment for that kind of environment..."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"It does! Want to see what I'm going in?"

#### [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) doesn't wait for a response and instead puts on her desert suit:
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Tada~"


**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Sure! I could use some tip--"
**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Oh!! So that's what you're going in? It looks loose, but covers the whole body."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yep! I wish it covered the hips though."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Hmm... I'll have to look into what I have for desert engagements. Worst comes to worst, I can just use my training gear."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That seems wise~" **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** nodded and continued: "Also! A mask might be a good idea, since inhaling sand isn't fun."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Hmm... I think I have a few options when it comes to masks."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**, now in her desert attire, sits down: "Yeah, there's probably something you can get at the shops~"

#### *The cafe waiter stops by their table and drops off their order.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Thank you~" **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** says to the waiter.

#### *The waiter nods to both of the girls and heads back to the counter.*

*[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) nodded back and picked up her iced tea to take a sip.*

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I better enjoy this. Might be a while until I get to remember what it's like to have something cold again."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Once Retem gets their supply chain back and running I'm sure there'll be cold drinks~"

*[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) begins to happily sip away at her smoothie while thinking about her eventual adventure in Retem.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"How is it?" [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) said and gazed at [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)'s smoothie.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**: "Delicious fruity cold sweetness~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Glad to hear~" She said, taking another sip from her tea: "My tea is, as the fancier people would say; it's simply delectable."

*As [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) happily drinks more of the smoothie, her eyes and the ends of her hair begin glowing a bit.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** notices the slight glow emitting from the hair, unsure if it's the sun hitting the blue hair: "Hey Yum-- Your hair is uhm..."
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"...Glowy...?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Humm?" She says and looks at where [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)'s gaze is going: "Oh!! That's nothing. Don't worry about it!" She says with dismissive cheer.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"S- Sure..." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) says, clearly unsure.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"It always happens when I'm eating something sweet. Fruits in particular."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Oh I see - is there an opposite effect when you eat something sour then?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Umm... not that I can tell. Sour stuff i okay for me I suppose."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Mm, okay~"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"I can use my hair like glowsticks if I want!"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)** giggles at the remark: "If you want!"

#### *[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) grabs the ends of her hair and does a small cheer with them like they were glowsticks*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**, amused with the performance, responds with throwing her own non-glowing hair about: "This is fun!"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Cha~ Cha~ Cha! Cha~ Cha~ Cha!"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Zun-zun-zun!~ Zun-zun-zun!~"

#### **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**, with tea in hand, begins dancing on her chair.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Yeah! Go [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)~ Go [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)!~"

#### *[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) also gets up and starts dancing with her glowstick hair*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah!~"
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"You've got moves too Yum-yum!~"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Wheee~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Do you wanna go and check out the bridge though? To Retem?" [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) said, putting down her hair.


**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Sounds great!"
#### *As [she](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) said that, then her hair-glow seemed to normalize again, though still shimmering with a distinct photonic glow.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Do you wanna walk, or should we take a Ryuker device?~"


**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Let's walk, might as well enjoy Aelio. Might be awhile till we see it again."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Alrighty~" [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) said, drinking her last sip of tea.

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)** follows suit and drinks down the last of her smoothie causing her hair to glow again.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Let's go!~"

#### The two shortlings exit the back gate of [Central City](SubIndexes/Places/CentralCity.md), with an heading to the Retem bridge.

**The rain began pouring right as [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) said**:	"It's nice, isn't it?"
**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: "Well, nevermind."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"It'll be a huge difference with all that sand and rock."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah!~"

#### The two kept walking for a while.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) stops for a moment to look at some roadsigns she'd never noticed before**:	"Huh... There are roadsigns..."

#### *[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) takes a short detour to grab a few peaches.*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) says to [Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) as she returns**:	"I've never really taken it this slow before... It's a nice change of pace."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Same, I usually just rush by to clear my daily tasks."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah-- Oh! I think I can see it!"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"So here it is, huh?"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Yeah~"

#### *[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md) Spots a Ryuker Device in the distance*

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Massive bridge, isn't it?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"*Tsk*... can't cross yet. Probably need permission from HQ before I can go."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"I see, I could quick-dial the commander if you want to go now?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Nah... I better do it by the books. I dun wanna get scolded if something goes a miss" She chuckles.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That seems like a reasonable idea."

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Let's plan a proper expedition at a later date. Maybe you can act as my guide since you are already familiar with traveling the desert."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That we can do~" **[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**: brings up her mag's interface and looks at a calender-like application: "Would two days from now work?"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"Okay, [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md), so I'll see you in a few days. Pretty sure my permissions for Retem will be ready by then."

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"That sounds good! Let's meet here again then~ *Ooo!* And if you can get anyone else to come along it'd be sweet!"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"The more the merrier~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Indeed~"

**[Yumesaki](SubIndexes/Characters/Yumesaki.md)**:	"In any case, I need to head out to take care of some stuff. I'll see you around later~"

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)**:	"Well, I'll see you here then." [Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) waves and runs across the bridge.

**[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) yells across the bridge**: "**BYE!!!**"
