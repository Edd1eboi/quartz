title: "Lady Lilit Lichenaes of Atlantis and Mercia III"
description: Lilit comes from the ancient fish kingdom known as Atlantis. She comes from a long line regents. Her father, The King of Atlantis, has been holding on to the throne to a long time. One day, Lilit's unbridled rage at her father's long reign eventually comes to a head when she decides to overthrow him. However, her attempt is unsuccessful and she must quickly flee the fish kingdom. In a shady, probably not legal, deal she acquired some legs and quickly began making her way to land. Above the sea she discovered a whole new world of weaponry and people, and made it her mission to learn from them and grow as powerful as she could.

### Personality:

She towers over most people she meets and stands out a lot in [Halpha](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md). Since she knows little about human culture and conventions, she may appear to be rude, lazy, crude or negligent. Inside however, she is a caring person, willing to do anything for her friends, especially those in [The Patrons](SubIndexes/Alliances/ThePatrons.md).
