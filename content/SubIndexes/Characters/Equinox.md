#### Personality:

[Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) shows basic emotion around others while her [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) Personality is in control and finds it incredibly difficult to trust people other than [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) (Dark Personality) and she rather that she keep to herself so that past events don’t repeat themselves. Due to her job as an ARKs operative, she has learned to open up to fellow operatives more easily.

While her Dark Personality is in control, she shows immense distrust to people around her other than [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) and sometimes an occasional bout of anger if anyone is too pushy getting close to her. She tends to be incredibly aggressive and rough with anyone who bothers her and spends a lot of time in the training rooms.

She avoids the subject of family as much as she can due to bitter memories and depending on the personality that is in control, if the subject is brought up, different reactions will occur.

#### Background (Pre-NGS):

##### [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) was born on the 21st of July in the family hospital alongside her sister into a noble kitsune family where they had lived a fairly carefree life, being brought up around their parents business and slowly learning that it wasn’t what it had been portrayed to be. As tradition with the rest of the family at birth, they were tested for compatibility with Photons in which they were to be taught how to use when they became of age, which they were both found to be highly compatible. Regardless of the questionable activities, she never questioned it as she didn’t think it was her place and so she carried on with life as normal until a series of unfortunate events occurred that changed her life forever.

On [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md)'s 16th birthday, due to her family business that had operated in a less than ethical manner for over a decade, members of the family and any associated with them were at risk of being targeted by groups that wanted to see justice for their actions. Regrettably, she had witnessed an assassination first hand and was left alive to send a message to the rest family.

The group had targeted her best friend's family who had many dealings with her own. It was a birthday like any other, [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) was spoiled and pampered by her family like every birthday before and her best friends was invited to celebrate with her. However, regardless of the occasion, the day turned out to be one of the worst in her life with her best friend being murdered in front of her. They were in the process of making their way to the dining room with her best friend's parents, her own parents and sister already there, to finally cut the cake when multiple masked assailants had burst through the windows, instantly taking down her friend's parents with swift strikes to their throats, their bodies hitting the floor with a thud.

The assailants then restrained the two girls and a knife was brought to her friends neck. “Remember this day, for this is what will happen to the rest of you” were the words she would remember forever before the assailant had dramatically cut her friends throat in a straight, clean line, her life instantly draining from her eyes. [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had wanted to scream, but her voice could not find its way from her throat. She had just sat there stiffly while the assassin made their clean escape until her own parents had eventually found her within the tragedy, surrounded with puddles of blood and a blank look in her eyes.

She felt herself break that day.

It took about 3 months after the assassination before her split personality became apparent. Constant whispers within her head consisting of dark thoughts became very prominent and while she tried to ignore them, they plagued her sleep as well. It eventually came to the fateful day where life got even worse than she thought it could.
 
She had been on her way to her sister's room to find some comfort from these dark thoughts, however on her way there, for no apparent reason, she had blacked out. When she had finally regained consciousness, she had found herself in her destination but instead of comfort, she found horror and sorrow. There was her sister, with a stab wound through her chest in place of her heart and to make matters worse, [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had looked down to see the murder weapon in her hand still fresh with blood. She was found soon after by her family, completely frozen in place and tears streaming down her face.
 
It was the very next day in which she not only was diagnosed with split personalities with her vague recount of what had happened and revealing she had been hearing voices in her head, but was also banished from the family due to the acts she had committed with the only promise of nothing being said. She had later figured this was likely to keep the families image up in the world of their business.
 
he had lived on the streets for a while, trusting no one but herself and with this came familiarity with the voice in her head which she had dubbed [](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) and who in turn had called her [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372). From talking with [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372), she had found they were polar opposites. Where she was calm and collected, [](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) was aggressive and rough. Due to their symbiotic bond and the passing months, they formed a bond out of necessity to survive and because of this, [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) had dialled in her violent tendencies and promised that she wouldn't force control if she was let out once in awhile which they found to be possible by manipulating the Photons inside them.

To survive the months alone, they had mainly worked at sketchier businesses that didn't care for her age and were in need of labour. This work had mostly been left to [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) who found it easier to adapt to the hard work as well as the fact she found she had an innate need to protect [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) from any further suffering in the world.

They had spent about 9 months of doing this before she decided they wanted to do something more with her life, perhaps by utilising their high compatibility for Photons. So on her 17th birthday, she applied to ARKs as a potential recruit and before long, they had been taking part in the ARKs training course. She had been required to disclose her split personality during her training which had prompted the ARKs counsellors, as well their scientists, to thoroughly evaluate her to make sure she was fit to be an operative and how she was able to enable the switch along with the changes in appearance for each personality. After thorough testing, [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had been approved for further training and due to her unique circumstances, had been given two specialities. [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) had found to be the perfect fit for an assassin, which she had thought to be ironic considering how she had been created, whereas [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) was found to be highly efficient as a healer with her need to stop anymore suffering within her life.

They worked their way through the ranks for the next 3 years, eventually becoming a well known operative throughout the ships for her unbreakable resolve to see every mission through and their stellar record for sustaining no casualties in any of their missions. They had also learned to further utilise their unique condition to the point they could now change their clothes when switching the personality in control, allowing for instantaneous response if a mission hadn't gone to plan. [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had become a very dependable Operative through the years enabling her the privilege of being acquainted with the upper Echelons of ARKs leading to her being sanctioned to the Council of Six as a specialist in her craft and candidate for any missions that were deemed confidential or too high a risk for other ARKs Operatives.

#### Background (Post-NGS):
##### Like most Meteorn, [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) awoke to the emergency pod's door hiss as it opened to an unfamiliar world, her heterochromatic eyes quickly adjusting to the sunlight spilling into the pod. Her first steps were unsteady as she stepped onto the beach, her mind trying to puzzle together anything that would explain her current situation but finding nothing but a clouded haze over her memories. 

Her body weak, from what she assumed was an extended stay in the pod, caused her head to spin as her legs gave out from under her. She fell to her knees at the ocean's edge, her face mere inches from the mirror-like water, her own face staring back looking confused and dazed. The reflection in front of her quickly morphed into a version of herself with black hair and red eyes as a voice rang out in her head calling the name "[Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372)", her mind bursting into splitting pain as she fell back into the sand cradling her head. A single name spilled from her lips as she passed out under the blazing sun, the memory of alter personality falling into place within her mind as if it were a puzzle piece. "[Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372)."

When [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) next awoke, she was in an unfamiliar city hidden away in the alleys between buildings, her head no longer in pure agony and her mind now clear with the only thing in mind. She had spoken her alter's name within their shared mind, the opposite personality quickly answering as they took comfort in each other's presence. [Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) had learned that when she had passed out, [](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) had taken control and gotten them to safety within the city which she had found was aptly named "[Central City](SubIndexes/Places/CentralCity.md)". Like her, [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) also had no recollection of how they had gotten to this strange new world and could only remember the other personality.

The two had quickly adapted to the new world, finding that others like her were a common occurrence and were referred to as "Meteorn". Those referred to as such seemed to be highly efficient as part of the local defense force; ARKs in a variety of job roles. 

[Light](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) had taken quickly to being a Tactical Operator as well as a Field Medic, finding that she had a particular knack for the support role and an innate need to protect those around her. [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372), on the other hand, had found she specialized more so in combat and preferred being on the battlefield destroying all the DOLLs she could with extreme efficiency. [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372), however, much preferred taking on her own jobs and tried to stay away from ARKs operations that were shrouded in regulations and operated more so like a mercenary completing whatever requests had interested her.

As part of her many jobs as both Operator and Mercenary, [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had met many others like her, one such person being [Gaia Stellaria](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md), who had struck her with a strange familiarity and sense of trust, a rare and unfamiliar feeling for the two personalities. They had struck a quick friendship over their similar hybrid states and [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) had found herself divulging her dual personality to the woman before long, who treated it as if it was entirely normal.

Through [Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md), she had met a group of people including a [Fish Princess](SubIndexes/Characters/Lilit.md) and her [Raptor partner](SubIndexes/Characters/GogoMes.md) along with a [Cat-Deuman hybrid](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md) similar to herself. [Equinox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md) found herself working closely with this group of people, providing tactical support for their missions and patching them up whenever needed. [Nox](SubIndexes/Characters/Equinox.md#^e1a372) still preferred to operate separately as of now as she doesn't wish to harm the relationships that her alter had been able to form with the news of their dual personality which many viewed as a terrible condition.
