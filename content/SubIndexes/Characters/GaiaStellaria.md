 ## Background:
 Tianea is an orphan from another ship.

Daughter to a pair of ace pilots(They didn't crash that often). Tianea lived a rather secluded existence at home while her parents were away on assignments for prolonged periods.

She was shy and reserved, but very studious and had a strong will to learn about anything that interested her. Mainly studying from home, she had above average grades, which could've been better if she had any interest in her subjects.

Medical Reports salvaged from her origin ship state she had some vitamin and mineral deficiencies and this was why she was mostly at home, which made her fragile and susceptible to sickness.

Years passed and while she kept her grades on above-average, but not the highest they could've been, she had started studying biology at home on the side, using plants. She managed to create a remedy for her deficiencies and solved many of her innate issues.

Said medicine only seemed to work on herself, indicating some variable that only matched with herself.

When she turned 16, tragedy struck. Her ship was one of the victims in a falspawn attack. Tianeas parents had quickly managed to have Tianea evacuated to another ship through their pilot contacts. Tianea had to leave it all behind in a rush, given only an ''emergency package'' of stuff to bring with her to Thorn.

As the shuttle took off, Tianea watched as her neighborhood collapsed into a massive cloud of dust and debris. When she arrived on Thorn, she was hurried off with no directions or any idea what to do. She was not sure if her parents were coming for her, but she assumed the best and waited near the Gate she had been dropped at.

 Days passed, no one had come for her. No one seemed to even have noticed she had been dropped off. Perhaps her shy and secluded nature removed her presence and made her invisible.

The last actual account of Tianea at this point was that she had disappeared into the city and vanished, with her emergency package in hand.  
This was also the last time she ever called herself Tianea.

Years passed and Gaia, as a nickname of sorts, had appeared in some dark alleys and rumours mentioning someone in an abandoned wing dealing with custom machinery, cast parts and making performance drugs.

This would prove to be Tianea, still researching, building and producing whatever she felt interested in and had the ability to work with.

Sometime after disappearing, Gaia had discovered a small photonic aptitude which she was capable of using as a supplement to her machinery and science. Also how she made medicine that only worked on herself, she had discovered.

She had also managed to pass ARKS training and become a member, both as a researcher and a soldier.

Today, she still offers custom tech services, both within engineering and biotech. She is also offering a selection of medicines and drugs, some which she donates to ARKS as a means of contributing.  
Somewhere between then and now, she has managed to splice her own DNA with that of dragons, causing her to sprout horns and tail, among other generally reptilian traits and also strengthening her body, curing herself of her frailness.
