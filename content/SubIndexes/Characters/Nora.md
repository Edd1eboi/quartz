### Personality:
	
Nora could be characterized as a plethora of things; many would say that she's a *neurotic* piece of work that is *crude*, *mischievous* and *snarky*. However, she often is very oblivious to this, *e.g*:
 
 >She'd eat a meal and say that it tastes bad, not due to her wanting to be mean or condescending - but because she doesn't think lying would be beneficial to the chef's development. Because, for her, food does not have any emotional connection to the chef. 

Though it is a nice underlying thought, she lacks the social know-how to express this in a good way without deeply offending most people, which inhibits her to befriend people.

## Background:
---
 ### Origins:
 *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)* awoke one day on a planet called *[Halpha](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md)* after having crashed down in a pod. She was one of many so-called *[Meteorns](SubIndexes/Concepts/Meteorns.md)*.

### Nora's past:


#### What she knows:

*[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora.md)*, along with most other *[Meteorns](SubIndexes/Concepts/Meteorns.md)*, can't remember much of her past. She has *vague* memories of her family spending time in cafés or restaurants, so she likes spending time at the café.

#### Her appearance:

Despite her appearance, *[Nora](SubIndexes/Characters/Nora)* is not a cat ~~nor a racoon~~, she's infact a genetic experiment where *[Gaia Stellaria](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)* spliced cat-DNA into her existing Deuman-DNA. The experiment that *[Gaia](SubIndexes/Characters/GaiaStellaria.md)* performed on her was mindbendingly painful and agonizing. Nowadays she doesn't remember the circumstances of her features due to the landing on *[Halpha](SubIndexes/Places/Halpha.md)*, though being curious about it, it does not bother her too much.
