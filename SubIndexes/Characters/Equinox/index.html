As tradition with the rest of the family at birth, they were tested for compatibility with Photons in which they were to be taught how to use when they became of age, which they were both found to be highly compatible. Regardless of the questionable activities, she never questioned it as she didn’t think it was her place and so she carried on with life as normal until a series of unfortunate events occurred that changed her life forever.
On Equinox&rsquo;s 16th birthday, due to her family business that had operated in a less than ethical manner for over a decade, members of the family and any associated with them were at risk of being targeted by groups that wanted to see justice for their actions. Regrettably, she had witnessed an assassination first hand and was left alive to send a message to the rest family.
The group had targeted her best friend&rsquo;s family who had many dealings with her own. It was a birthday like any other, Equinox was spoiled and pampered by her family like every birthday before and her best friends was invited to celebrate with her. However, regardless of the occasion, the day turned out to be one of the worst in her life with her best friend being murdered in front of her. They were in the process of making their way to the dining room with her best friend&rsquo;s parents, her own parents and sister already there, to finally cut the cake when multiple masked assailants had burst through the windows, instantly taking down her friend&rsquo;s parents with swift strikes to their throats, their bodies hitting the floor with a thud.
The assailants then restrained the two girls and a knife was brought to her friends neck. “Remember this day, for this is what will happen to the rest of you” were the words she would remember forever before the assailant had dramatically cut her friends throat in a straight, clean line, her life instantly draining from her eyes. Equinox had wanted to scream, but her voice could not find its way from her throat. She had just sat there stiffly while the assassin made their clean escape until her own parents had eventually found her within the tragedy, surrounded with puddles of blood and a blank look in her eyes.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She felt herself break that day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It took about 3 months after the assassination before her split personality became apparent. Constant whispers within her head consisting of dark thoughts became very prominent and while she tried to ignore them, they plagued her sleep as well. It eventually came to the fateful day where life got even worse than she thought it could.
She had been on her way to her sister&rsquo;s room to find some comfort from these dark thoughts, however on her way there, for no apparent reason, she had blacked out. When she had finally regained consciousness, she had found herself in her destination but instead of comfort, she found horror and sorrow. There was her sister, with a stab wound through her chest in place of her heart and to make matters worse, Equinox had looked down to see the murder weapon in her hand still fresh with blood. She was found soon after by her family, completely frozen in place and tears streaming down her face.
It was the very next day in which she not only was diagnosed with split personalities with her vague recount of what had happened and revealing she had been hearing voices in her head, but was also banished from the family due to the acts she had committed with the only promise of nothing being said. She had later figured this was likely to keep the families image up in the world of their business.
She had lived on the streets for a while, trusting no one but herself and with this came familiarity with the voice in her head which she had dubbed Nox and who in turn had called her Light. From talking with Nox, she had found they were polar opposites. Where she was calm and collected, Nox was aggressive and rough. Due to their symbiotic bond and the passing months, they formed a bond out of necessity to survive and because of this, Nox had dialled in her violent tendencies and promised that she wouldn&rsquo;t force control if she was let out once in awhile which they found to be possible by manipulating the Photons inside them.
To survive the months alone, they had mainly worked at sketchier businesses that didn&rsquo;t care for her age and were in need of labour. This work had mostly been left to Nox who found it easier to adapt to the hard work as well as the fact she found she had an innate need to protect Light from any further suffering in the world.
They had spent about 9 months of doing this before she decided they wanted to do something more with her life, perhaps by utilising their high compatibility for Photons. So on her 17th birthday, she applied to ARKs as a potential recruit and before long, they had been taking part in the ARKs training course. She had been required to disclose her split personality during her training which had prompted the ARKs counsellors, as well their scientists, to thoroughly evaluate her to make sure she was fit to be an operative and how she was able to enable the switch along with the changes in appearance for each personality. After thorough testing, Equinox had been approved for further training and due to her unique circumstances, had been given two specialities. Nox had found to be the perfect fit for an assassin, which she had thought to be ironic considering how she had been created, whereas Light was found to be highly efficient as a healer with her need to stop anymore suffering within her life.
They worked their way through the ranks for the next 3 years, eventually becoming a well known operative throughout the ships for her unbreakable resolve to see every mission through and their stellar record for sustaining no casualties in any of their missions. They had also learned to further utilise their unique condition to the point they could now change their clothes when switching the personality in control, allowing for instantaneous response if a mission hadn&rsquo;t gone to plan. Equinox had become a very dependable Operative through the years enabling her the privilege of being acquainted with the upper Echelons of ARKs leading to her being sanctioned to the Council of Six as a specialist in her craft and candidate for any missions that were deemed confidential or too high a risk for other ARKs Operatives.</p></blockquote><h4 id=background-post-ngs>Background (Post-NGS):</h4><blockquote><p><em>Wah!</em></p></blockquote></article><hr><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Eddie / Nora using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2021</p><a href=../../../>Home</a>
